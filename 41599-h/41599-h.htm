<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="f8">HOW GEORGE NESTON JUMPED.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Nestons, of Tottlebury Grange in the
county of Suffolk, were an ancient and honourable
family, never very distinguished or very
rich, but yet for many generations back
always richer and more distinguished than
the common run of mankind. The men had
been for the most part able and upright,
tenacious of their claims, and mindful of their
duties; the women had respected their betters,
exacted respect from their inferiors, and
educated their brothers&rsquo; wives in the Neston
ways; and the whole race, while confessing
individual frailties, would have been puzzled
to point out how, as a family, it had failed to
live up to the position in which Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and the Constitution had placed it. The
error, if any, had indeed been on the other
side in one or two cases. The last owner of
the Grange, a gay old bachelor, had scorned
the limits of his rents and his banking-account,
and added victories on the turf to the family
laurels at a heavy cost to the family revenues.
His sudden death had been mourned as a
personal loss, but silently acknowledged as a
dynastic gain, and ten years of the methodical
rule of his brother Roger had gone far to
efface the ravages of his merry reign. The
younger sons of the Nestons served the State
or adorned the professions, and Roger had
spent a long and useful life in the Office of
Commerce. He had been a valuable official,
and his merits had not gone unappreciated.
Fame he had neither sought nor attained,
and his name had come but little before
the public, its rare appearances in the newspapers
generally occurring on days when our
Gracious Sovereign completed another year of
her beneficent life, and was pleased to mark
the occasion by conferring honour on Mr.
Roger Neston. When this happened, all the
leader-writers looked him up in &ldquo;Men of
the Time,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Whitaker,&rdquo; or some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
standard work of reference, and remarked
that few appointments would meet with more
universal public approval, a proposition which
the public must be taken to have endorsed
with tacit unanimity.</p>

<p>Mr. Neston went on his way, undisturbed by
his moments of notoriety, but quietly pleased
with his red ribbon, and, when he entered
into possession of the family estate, continued
to go to the office with unabated regularity.
At last he reached the pinnacle of his particular
ambition, and, as Permanent Head of
his Department, for fifteen years took a large
share in the government of a people almost
unconscious of his existence, until the moment
when it saw the announcement that on his
retirement he had been raised to the peerage
by the title of Baron Tottlebury. Then the
chorus of approval broke forth once again,
and the new lord had many friendly pats on
the back he was turning to public life.
Henceforth he sat silent in the House of
Lords, and wrote letters to the <cite>Times</cite> on
subjects which the cares of office had not
previously left him leisure to study.</p>

<p>But fortune was not yet tired of smiling on
the Nestons. Lord Tottlebury, before accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his new dignity, had impressed upon his
son Gerald the necessity of seeking the wherewith
to gild the coronet by a judicious marriage.
Gerald was by no means loth. He had never
made much progress at the Bar, and felt that
his want of success contrasted unfavourably
with the growing practice of his cousin George,
a state of things very unfitting, as George
represented a younger branch than Gerald.
A rich marriage, combined with his father&rsquo;s
improved position, opened to him prospects
of a career of public distinction, and, what
was more important, of private leisure, better
fitted to his tastes and less trying to his
patience; and, by an unusual bit of luck, he
was saved from any scruples about marrying
for money by the fact that he was already
desperately in love with a very rich woman.
She was of no high birth, it is true, and she
was the widow of a Manchester merchant;
but this same merchant, to the disgust of his
own relatives, had left her five thousand a year
at her absolute disposal. The last fact easily
outweighed the two first in Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s
mind, while Gerald rested his action on the
sole ground that Neaera Witt was the
prettiest girl in London, and, by Jove, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
believed in the world; only, of course, if she
had money too, all the better.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the engagement was an accomplished
fact. Mrs. Witt had shown no more
than a graceful disinclination to become Mrs.
Neston. At twenty-five perpetual devotion
to the memory of such a mere episode as her
first marriage had been was neither to be
desired nor expected, and Neaera was very
frankly in love with Gerald Neston, a handsome,
open-faced, strapping fellow, who won
her heart mainly because he was so very unlike
the late Mr. Witt. Everybody envied
Gerald, and everybody congratulated Neaera
on having escaped the various chasms that
are supposed to yawn in the path of rich
young widows. The engagement was announced
once, and contradicted as premature,
and then announced again; and, in a
word, everything pursued its pleasant and
accustomed course in these matters. Finally,
Lord Tottlebury in due form entertained
Mrs. Witt at dinner, by way of initiation
into the Neston mysteries.</p>

<p>It was for this dinner that Mr. George
Neston, barrister-at-law, was putting on his
white tie one May evening in his chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
off Piccadilly. George was the son of Lord
Tottlebury&rsquo;s younger brother. His father
had died on service in India, leaving a wife,
who survived him but a few years, and one
small boy, who had developed into a rising
lawyer of two or three-and-thirty, and was
at this moment employed in thinking what a
lucky dog Gerald was, if all people said about
Mrs. Witt were true. Not that George
envied his cousin his bride. His roving days
were over. He had found what he wanted
for himself, and Mrs. Witt&rsquo;s beauty, if she
were beautiful, was nothing to him. So he
thought with mingled joy and resignation.
Still, however much you may be in love with
somebody else, a pretty girl with five thousand
a year is luck, and there&rsquo;s an end of it! So
concluded George Neston as he got into his
hansom, and drove to Portman Square.</p>

<p>The party was but small, for the Nestons
were not one of those families that ramify
into bewildering growths of cousins. Lord
Tottlebury of course was there, a tall, spare,
rather stern-looking man, and his daughter
Maud, a bright and pretty girl of twenty,
and Gerald, in a flutter ill concealed by the
very extravagance of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</i>. Then there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were a couple of aunts and a male cousin and
his wife, and George himself. Three of the
guests were friends, not relatives. Mrs.
Bourne had been the chosen intimate of Lord
Tottlebury&rsquo;s dead wife, and he honoured his
wife&rsquo;s memory by constant attention to her
friend. Mrs. Bourne brought her daughter
Isabel, and Isabel had come full of curiosity
to see Mrs. Witt, and also hoping to see
George Neston, for did she not know what
pleasure it would give him to meet her?
Lastly, there towered on the rug the huge
form of Mr. Blodwell, Q.C., an old friend of
Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s and George&rsquo;s first tutor
and kindly guide in the law, famous for
rasping speeches in court and good stories
out of it, famous, too, as one of the tallest
men and quite the fattest man at the Bar.
Only Neaera Witt was wanting, and before
Mr. Blodwell had got well into the famous
story about Baron Samuel and the dun cow
Neaera Witt was announced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Witt&rsquo;s widowhood was only two years
old, and she was at this time almost unknown
to society. None of the party, except Gerald
and his father, had seen her, and they all
looked with interest to the door when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
butler announced her name. She had put
off her mourning altogether for the first time,
and came in clothed in a gown of deep red,
with a long train that gave her dignity, her
golden hair massed low on her neck, and her
pale, clear complexion just tinged with the
suspicion of a blush as she instinctively
glanced round for her lover. The entry was,
no doubt, a small triumph. The girls were
lost in generous admiration; the men were
startled; and Mr. Blodwell, finishing the
evening at the House of Commons, remarked
to young Sidmouth Vane, the Lord President&rsquo;s
private secretary (unpaid), &ldquo;I hope,
my boy, you may live as long as I have,
and see as many pretty women; but you&rsquo;ll
never see a prettier than Mrs. Witt. Her
face! her hair! and Vane, my boy, her
waist!&rdquo; But here the division-bell rang,
and Mr. Blodwell hastened off to vote against
a proposal aimed at deteriorating, under the
specious pretence of cheapening, the administration
of justice.</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury, advancing to meet Neaera,
took her by the hand and proudly presented
her to his guests. She greeted each gracefully
and graciously until she came to George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Neston. As she saw his solid jaw and clean-shaved
keen face, a sudden light that looked
like recollection leaped to her eyes, and her
cheek flushed a little. The change was so
distinct that George was confirmed in the
fancy he had had from the first moment she
came in, that somewhere before he had seen
that golden hair and those dark eyes, that
combination of harmonious opposites that
made her beauty no less special in kind than
in degree. He advanced a step, his hand held
half out, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there he stopped dead, and his hand
fell to his side, for all signs of recognition had
faded from Mrs. Witt&rsquo;s face, and she gave
him only the same modestly gracious bow
that she had bestowed on the rest of the
party. The incident was over, leaving
George sorely puzzled, and Lord Tottlebury
a little startled. Gerald had seen nothing,
having been employed in issuing orders for
the march in to dinner.</p>

<p>The dinner was a success. Lord Tottlebury
unbent; he was very cordial and, at moments,
almost jovial. Gerald was in heaven, or at
least sitting directly opposite and in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
view of it. Mr. Blodwell enjoyed himself
immensely: his classic stories had never yet
won so pleasant a reward as Neaera&rsquo;s low
rich laugh and dancing eyes. George ought
to have enjoyed himself, for he was next
to Isabel Bourne, and Isabel, heartily recognising
that she was not to-night, as, to do her
justice, she often was, the prettiest girl in
the room, took the more pains to be kind
and amusing. But George was ransacking
the lumber-rooms of memory, or, to put it
less figuratively, wondering, and growing
exasperated as he wondered in vain, where
the deuce he&rsquo;d seen the girl before. Once
or twice his eyes met hers, and it seemed
to him that he had caught her casting an
inquiring apprehensive glance at him. When
she saw that he was looking, her expression
changed into one of friendly interest, appropriate
to the examination of a prospective
kinsman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of her?&rdquo; asked Isabel
Bourne, in a low voice. &ldquo;Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is indeed,&rdquo; George answered, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help thinking I&rsquo;ve seen her somewhere
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a person one would remember,
isn&rsquo;t she? Was it in Manchester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I haven&rsquo;t been in
Manchester more than two or three times
in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Maud says Mrs. Witt wasn&rsquo;t
brought up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was she brought up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
think Maud knew either. I asked Gerald,
and he said she probably dropped down from
heaven somewhere a few years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s how I come to remember
her,&rdquo; suggested George.</p>

<p>Failing this explanation, he confessed
himself puzzled, and determined to dismiss
the matter from his thoughts for the present.
Aided by Isabel Bourne, he was very successful
in this effort: a pretty girl&rsquo;s company
is the best modern substitute for the waters of
Lethe.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his interest remained strong
enough to make him join the group which
Gerald and Mr. Blodwell formed with Neaera
as soon as the men went upstairs. Mr. Blodwell
made no secret of the fact that it was
with him a case of love at first sight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
openly regretted that his years prevented
him fighting Gerald for his prize. Gerald
listened with the complacent happiness of a
secure lover, and Neaera gravely apologised
for not having waited to make her choice till
she had seen Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at least you had heard of me?&rdquo; he
urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am terribly ignorant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe I ever did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neaera&rsquo;s not one of the criminal classes,
you see, sir,&rdquo; Gerald put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He taunts me,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Blodwell,
&ldquo;with the Old Bailey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George had come up in time to hear the
last two remarks. Neaera saw him, and
smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a young lady who knows nothing
about the law, George,&rdquo; continued Blodwell.
&ldquo;She never heard of me&mdash;nor of you either,
I dare say. It reminds me of what they
used to say about old Dawkins. Old Daw
never had a brief, but he was Recorder
of some little borough or other&mdash;place
with a prisoner once in two years, you
know&mdash;I forget the name. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;yes,
Peckton.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Peckton!&rdquo; exclaimed George Neston,
loudly and abruptly.</p>

<p>Neaera made a sudden motion with one
hand&mdash;a sudden motion suddenly checked&mdash;and
her fan dropped with a clatter on the
polished boards.</p>

<p>Gerald dived for it, so did Mr. Blodwell,
and their heads came in contact with such
violence as to drive all reminiscences of
Recorder Dawkins out of Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s
brain. They were still indulging in recriminations,
when Neaera swiftly left them,
crossed to Lord Tottlebury, and took her
leave.</p>

<p>George went to open the door for her.
She looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come and see me, Mr. Neston?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>He bowed gravely, answering nothing.</p>

<p>The party broke up, and as George was
seeing Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s bulk fitted into a four-wheeler,
the old gentleman asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that, George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump, when I said Peckton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I used to go sessions there, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always jump when people mention
the places you used to go sessions at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Generally,&rdquo; replied George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell, lighting his
cigar. &ldquo;A bad habit, George; it excites
remark. Tell him the House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night, sir,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I hope
your head is better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell snorted indignantly as he
pulled up the window, and was driven away
to his duties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f8">WHY GEORGE NESTON JUMPED.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;How</span> could I ever have forgotten?&rdquo; said
George, aloud, as he walked home. &ldquo;I remember
her now as if it was yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Memory, like much else that appertains to
man, is a queer thing, and the name of Peckton
had supplied the one link missing in his recollection.
How, indeed, had he ever forgotten
it? Can a man forget his first brief any
more than his first love?&mdash;so like are they in
their infinite promise, so like in their very
finite results!</p>

<p>The picture was now complete in his
mind: the little, muggy court at Peckton;
old Dawkins, his wig black with age, the
rest of him brown with snuff; the fussy
clerk; the prosecuting counsel, son to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
same fussy clerk; he himself, thrusting his
first guinea into his pocket with shaking
hand and beating heart (nervous before old
Daw! Imagine!); the fat, peaceful policeman;
the female warder, in her black straw-bonnet
trimmed with dark-blue ribbons; and
last of all, in the dock, a young girl, in
shabby, nay, greasy, black, with pale cheeks,
disordered hair, and swollen eyelids, gazing
in blank terror on the majesty of the law,
strangely expressed in the Recorder&rsquo;s ancient
person. And, beyond all doubt or imagination
of a doubt, the girl was Gerald&rsquo;s bride,
Neaera Witt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could swear to her to-day!&rdquo; cried
George.</p>

<p>She had scraped together a guinea for his
fee. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where she got it from,&rdquo;
the fat policeman said with professional
cynicism as he gave it to George. &ldquo;She
pleads guilty and wants you to address
the court.&rdquo; So George had, with infinite
trepidation, addressed the court.</p>

<p>The girl had a father&mdash;drunk when not
starving, and starving when not drunk. Now
he was starving, and she had stolen the shoes
(oh! the sordidness of it all!) to pawn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
buy food&mdash;or drink. It was a case for a
caution merely&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and George himself,
being young to the work, stammered
and stuttered as much from emotion as from
fright. You see the girl was pretty!</p>

<p>All old Daw said was, &ldquo;Do you know
anything about her, policeman?&rdquo; and the
fat policeman said her father was a bad lot,
and the girl did no work, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said old Daw; and,
leaning forward, he pronounced his sentence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal lightly with you. Only&rdquo;&mdash;shaking
a snuffy forefinger&mdash;&ldquo;take care you
don&rsquo;t come here again! One calendar month,
with hard labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the girl, gazing back at honest old
Daw, who would not have hurt a fly except
from the Bench, softly murmured, &ldquo;Cruel,
cruel, cruel!&rdquo; and was led away by the
woman in the black straw bonnet.</p>

<p>Whereupon George did a very unprofessional
thing. He gave his guinea, his
firstborn son, back to the fat policeman, saying,
&ldquo;Give it her when she comes out. I
can&rsquo;t take her money.&rdquo; At which the policeman
smiled a smile that convicted George of
terrible youthfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all complete&mdash;all except the name
by which the fussy clerk had called on the
girl to plead, and which old Dawkins had
mumbled out in sentencing her. That
utterly escaped him. He was sure it
was not &ldquo;Neaera&rdquo;&mdash;of course not &ldquo;Neaera
Witt;&rdquo; but not &ldquo;Neaera Anything,&rdquo; either.
He would have remembered &ldquo;Neaera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth was it?&rdquo; he asked himself
as he unlocked his door and went upstairs.
&ldquo;Not that it matters much. Names are
easily changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George Neston shared his chambers in
Half Moon Street with the Honourable
Thomas Buchanan Fillingham Myles, commonly
known (as the peerage has it) as
Tommy Myles. Tommy also had a small
room in the Temple Chambers, where the
two Nestons and Mr. Blodwell pursued their
livelihood; but Tommy&rsquo;s appearances at the
latter resort were few and brief. He did not
trouble George much in Half Moon Street
either, being a young man much given to
society of all sorts, and very prone to be in
bed when most people are up, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>.
However, to-night he happened to be at
home, and George found him with his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
on the mantelpiece, reading the evening
paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s uncommonly pretty, and very pleasant,&rdquo;
said George. Why say more, before his mind
was made up?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; pursued Tommy, rising
and filling his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I don&rsquo;t know. I wish I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see that it matters to you. Anybody
else there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a few people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bourne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy winked, sighed prodigiously, and
took a large drink of brandy and soda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; asked George,
changing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, to the Escurial&mdash;to a vulgar, really
a very vulgar entertainment&mdash;as vulgar as
you could find in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going out again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear George! It&rsquo;s close on twelve!&rdquo;
said Tommy, in reproving tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or to bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. George, you hurt my feelings. Can
it be that you wish to be alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, hold your tongue,
Tommy. I want to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one word. Has she been cruel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, get out. Here, give me a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy subsided into the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>, that
famous print whose motto is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lux in tenebris</i>
(meaning, of course, publicity in shady
places), and George set himself to consider
what he had best do in the matter of Neaera
Witt.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the situation were obvious
enough, but to George&rsquo;s mind they consisted
not so much in the question of what to do as
in that of how to do it. He had been tolerably
clear from the first that Gerald must not
marry Neaera without knowing what he
could tell him; if he liked to do it afterwards,
well and good. But of course he
would not. No Neston would, thought
George, who had his full share of the family
pride. Men of good family made disgraceful
marriages, it is true, but not with thieves;
and anyhow nothing of the kind was recorded
in the Neston annals. How should he look
his uncle and Gerald in the face if he held
his tongue? His course was very clear.
Only&mdash;well, it was an uncommonly disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
part to be cast for&mdash;the denouncer and
exposer of a woman who very probably was
no worse than many another, and was unquestionably
a great deal better-looking than
most others. The whole position smacked
unpleasantly of melodrama, and George must
figure in the character of the villain, a villain
with the best motives and the plainest duty.
One hope only there was. Perhaps Mrs.
Witt would see the wisdom of a timely withdrawal.
Surely she would. She could never
face the storm. Then Gerald need know
nothing about it, and six months&rsquo; travel&mdash;say
to America, where pretty girls live&mdash;would
bind up his broken heart. Only&mdash;again only&mdash;George
did not much fancy the interview
that lay before him. Mrs. Witt would probably
cry, and he would feel a brute,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Neston,&rdquo; announced Tommy&rsquo;s valet,
opening the door.</p>

<p>Gerald had followed his cousin home, very
anxious to be congratulated, and still more
anxious not to appear anxious. Tommy
received him with effusion. Why hadn&rsquo;t he
been asked to the dinner? Might he call on
Mrs. Witt? He heard she was a clipper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and so forth. George&rsquo;s felicitations stuck in
his throat, but he got them out, hoping that
Neaera would free him from the necessity of
eating them up at some early date. Gerald
was radiant. He seemed to have forgotten
all about &ldquo;Peckton,&rdquo; though he was loud in
denouncing the unnatural hardness of Mr.
Blodwell&rsquo;s head. Oh, and the last thing
Neaera said was, would George go and
see her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;She took quite a fancy to you, old man,&rdquo;
he said affectionately. &ldquo;She said you
reminded her of a judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George smiled. Was Neaera practising
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entente</i> on her betrothed?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an infernally unpleasant thing to
say!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall go and see her,&rdquo; said
George,&mdash;&ldquo;to-morrow, if I can find time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; added Tommy.</p>

<p>Gerald was pleased. He liked to see his
taste endorsed with the approbation of his
friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time old George, here,
followed suit, isn&rsquo;t it, Tommy? I&rsquo;ve given
him a lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s attachment to Isabel Bourne was
an accepted fact among his acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
He never denied it: he did like her very
much, and meant to marry her, if she would
have him. And he did not really doubt that
she would. If he had doubted, he would not
have been so content to rest without an
express assurance. As it was, there was no
hurry. Let the practice grow a little more
yet. He and Isabel understood one another,
and, as soon as she was ready, he was ready.
But long engagements were a nuisance to
everybody. These were his feelings, and he
considered himself, by virtue of them, to be
in love with Isabel. There are many ways
of being in love, and it would be a want of
toleration to deny that George&rsquo;s is one of
them, although it is certainly very unlike
some of the others.</p>

<p>Tommy agreed that George was wasting
his time, and with real kindness led Gerald
back to the subject which filled his mind.</p>

<p>Gerald gladly embraced the opportunity.
&ldquo;Where did I meet her? Oh, down at
Brighton, last winter. Then, you know, I
pursued her to Manchester, and found her
living in no end of a swell villa in the
outskirts of that abominable place. Neaera
hated it, but of course she had to live there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
while Witt was alive, and she had kept the
house on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t Manchester-born, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know where she was born.
Her father seems to have been a romantic
sort of old gentleman. He was a painter by
trade&mdash;an artist, I mean, you know,&mdash;landscapes
and so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And went about looking for bits of nature
to murder, eh?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it. I don&rsquo;t think he was
any great shakes at it. At least, he didn&rsquo;t
make much; and at last he settled in
Manchester, and tried to pick up a living,
working for the dealers. Witt was a picture-fancier,
and, when Neaera came to sell, he
saw her, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The late Witt&rsquo;s romance began?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, confound him! I&rsquo;m beastly jealous
of old Witt, though he is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ungrateful,&rdquo; remarked George,
&ldquo;considering&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! You&rsquo;ll wound his feelings,&rdquo; said
Tommy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgotten all about the cash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Gerald
began.</p>

<p>But George cut in, &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Witt&rsquo;s? Oh, Jeremiah, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Witt? No. Hang Witt! The father&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Gale. A queer old boy he seems to
have been&mdash;a bit of a scholar as well as an
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That accounts for the &lsquo;Neaera,&rsquo; I
suppose,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neaera Gale,&rdquo; thought George. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
remember that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the infatuated
Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dry up!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t indulge you any more. Go home to
bed. You can dream about her, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald accepted this hint, and retired, still
in that state of confident bliss that filled
George&rsquo;s breast with trouble and dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well be the serpent in Eden,&rdquo;
he said, as he lay in bed, smoking dolefully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="f8">&ldquo;WHAT ARE QUARTER-SESSIONS?&rdquo;</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere was stormy at No. 3,
Indenture Buildings, Temple. It was four
o&rsquo;clock, and Mr. Blodwell had come out of
court in the worst of bad tempers. He was
savage with George Neston, who, being in a
case with him, had gone away and left him
with nobody to tell him his facts. He was
savage with Tommy Myles, who had refused
to read some papers for him; savage with
Mr. Justice Pounce, who had cut up his
speech to the jury,&mdash;Pounce, who had been
his junior a hundred times!&mdash;savage with
Mr. Timms, his clerk, because he was always
savage with Timms when he was savage with
other people. Tommy had fled before the
storm; and now, to Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
indignation, George also was brushing his hat
with the manifest intention of departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my time, rising juniors,&rdquo; said Mr.
Blodwell, with sarcasm, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t leave
chambers at four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business,&rdquo; said George, putting on his
gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women,&rdquo; answered his leader, briefly and
scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing, in this case. I am
going to see Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s person expressed moral
reprobation. George, however, remained
unmoved, and the elder man stole a sharp
glance at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up, George,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you jump?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Timms, a hansom,&rdquo; cried George. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be in court all day to-morrow, and keep you
straight, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, do. That fellow
Pounce is such a beggar for dates. Now
get out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Witt was living at Albert Mansions,
the &ldquo;swell villa&rdquo; at Manchester having gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to join Mr. Witt in limbo. She was at home,
and, as George entered, his only prayer was
that he might not find Gerald in possession.
He had no very clear idea how to proceed in
his unpleasant task. &ldquo;It must depend on
how she takes it,&rdquo; he said. Gerald was not
there, but Tommy Myles was, voluble, cheerful,
and very much at home, telling Neaera
stories of her lover&rsquo;s school-days. George
chimed in as he best could, until Tommy rose
to go, regretting the convention that drove
one man to take his hat five minutes, at the
latest, after another came in. Neaera pressed
him to come again, but did not invite him to
transgress the convention.</p>

<p>George almost hoped she would, for he
was, as he confessed to himself, &ldquo;funking
it.&rdquo; There were no signs of any such feeling
in Neaera, and no repetition of the appealing
attitude she had seemed to take up the night
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She means to bluff me,&rdquo; thought George,
as he watched her sit down in a low chair by
the fire, and shade her face with a large
fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;so delightful to be
welcomed by all Gerald&rsquo;s family and friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
so heartily. I do not feel the least like a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came last night, hoping to join in that
welcome,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did not feel that you were a stranger
at all. Gerald had told me so much about
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George rose, and walked to the end of the
little room and back. Then he stood looking
down at his hostess. Neaera gazed pensively
into the fire. It was uncommonly difficult,
but what was the good of fencing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you recognised me,&rdquo; he said, deliberately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute. I had seen your photograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only my photograph, but myself,
Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; asked Neaera. &ldquo;How rude of
me to forget! Where was it? Brighton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s heart hardened a little. Of course
she would lie, poor girl. He didn&rsquo;t mind
that. But he did not like artistic lying, and
Neaera&rsquo;s struck him as artistic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you sure?&rdquo; she went on.</p>

<p>George decided to try a sudden attack.
&ldquo;Did they ever give you that guinea?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
he said, straining his eyes to watch her face.
Did she flush or not? He really couldn&rsquo;t say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. Guinea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Mrs. Witt, we needn&rsquo;t make it
more unpleasant than necessary. I saw you
recognised me. The moment Mr. Blodwell
spoke of Peckton I recognised you. Pray
don&rsquo;t think I mean to be hard on you. I can
and do make every allowance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera&rsquo;s face expressed blank astonishment.
She rose, and made a step towards the
bell. George was tickled. She had the
amazing impertinence to convey, subtly but
quite distinctly, by that motion and her
whole bearing, that she thought he was
drunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring, if you like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or, rather,
ask me, if you want the bell rung. But
wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to settle the matter
now? I don&rsquo;t want to trouble Gerald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really believe you are threatening me
with something,&rdquo; exclaimed Neaera. &ldquo;Yes,
by all means. Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She motioned him to a chair, and stood
above him, leaning one arm on the mantelpiece.
She breathed a little quickly, but
George drew no inference from that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight years ago,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;you
employed me as your counsel. You were
charged with theft&mdash;stealing a pair of shoes&mdash;at
Peckton Quarter-Sessions. You retained
me at a fee of one guinea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera was motionless, but a slight smile
showed itself on her face. &ldquo;What are Quarter-Sessions?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pleaded guilty to the charge, and
were sentenced to a month&rsquo;s imprisonment
with hard labour. The guinea I asked you
about was my fee. I gave it to that fat policeman
to give back to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Neston, but it&rsquo;s really too
absurd.&rdquo; And Neaera relaxed her statuesque
attitude, and laughed light-heartedly, deliciously.
&ldquo;No wonder you were startled last
night&mdash;oh, yes, I saw that&mdash;if you identified
your cousin&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i> with this criminal you&rsquo;re
talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did and do identify her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly. It would be a poor joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard anything so monstrous.
Do you really persist in it? I don&rsquo;t know
what to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you deny it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Deny it! I might as well deny&mdash;but of
course I deny it. It&rsquo;s madness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must lay what I know before my
uncle and Gerald, and leave them to act as
they think best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera took a step forward as George rose
from his seat. &ldquo;Do you mean to repeat
this atrocious&mdash;this insane scandal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must. I should be glad to
think I had any alternative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera raised one white hand above her
head, and brought it down through the air
with a passionate gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warn you not!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I warn
you not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a lie, and&mdash;and if it were true, you
could not prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George thought this her first false step.
But there were no witnesses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be war between us,&rdquo; she went on
in growing excitement. &ldquo;I will stand at
nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;to crush you; and I will
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not try to frighten me,&rdquo; said
George.</p>

<p>Neaera surveyed him from head to foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Then she stretched out her white hand again,
and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George shrugged his shoulders, took his
hat, and went, feeling very much as if Neaera
had detected him in theft. So great is the
virtue of a good presence and dramatic
instincts.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused; then he went back
again, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; cried Neaera.</p>

<p>As he entered she made an impatient
movement. She was still standing where he
had left her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray pardon me. I forgot to say one
thing. Of course I am only interested in
this&mdash;matter, as one of the family. I am
not a detective. If you give up Gerald, my
mouth is sealed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not give up Gerald,&rdquo; she exclaimed
passionately. &ldquo;I love him. I am not an
adventuress; I am rich already. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could look higher than Gerald,
and avoid all this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I love him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George believed her. &ldquo;I wish to God I
could spare you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare me? I don&rsquo;t ask your mercy.
You are a slanderer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I would tell you,&rdquo; said George
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not go?&rdquo; she cried. And her
voice broke into a sob.</p>

<p>This was worse than her tragedy airs.
George fled without another word, cursing
himself for a hard-hearted, self-righteous prig,
and then cursing fate that laid this burden
on him. What was she doing now, he wondered.
Exulting in her triumph? He hoped
so; for a different picture obstinately filled
his mind&mdash;a beautiful woman, her face buried
in her white arms, crying the brightness out
of her eyes, all because George Neston had
a sense of duty. Still he did not seriously
waver in his determination. If Neaera had
admitted the whole affair and besought his
mercy, he felt that his resolution would have
been sorely tried. But, as it was, he carried
away the impression that he had to deal with
a practised hand, and perhaps a little professional
zeal mingled with his honest feeling
that a woman who would lie like that was a
woman who ought to be shown in her true
colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell uncle Roger and Gerald to-morrow,&rdquo;
he thought. &ldquo;Of course they will
ask for proof. That means a journey to
Peckton. Confound other people&rsquo;s affairs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s surmise was right. Neaera Witt
had spent the first half-hour after his departure
in a manner fully as heart-rending as he
had imagined. Everything was going so
well. Gerald was so charming, and life
looked, at last, so bright, and now came this!
But Gerald was to dine with her, and there
was not much time to waste in crying. She
dried her eyes, and doctored them back into
their lustre, and made a wonderful toilette.
Then she entertained Gerald, and filled him
with delight all a long evening. And at
eleven o&rsquo;clock, just as she was driving him
out of his paradise, she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your cousin George was here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, was he? How did you get on
with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera had brought her lover his hat.
He needed a strong hint to move him. But
she put the hat down, and knelt beside Gerald
for a minute or two in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look sad, darling,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did
you and George quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; It&rsquo;s very dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what, my sweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t tell you now. He shan&rsquo;t say
I got hold of you first, and prepossessed
your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world is wrong, Neaera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will hear, Gerald, soon. But you
shall hear it from him. I will not&mdash;no, I
will not be the first. But, Gerald dear, you
will not believe anything against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does George say anything against
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera threw her arms round his neck.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let him take care what it is.
Neaera, tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! He shall tell you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was firm; and Gerald went away, a
very mass of amazement and wrath.</p>

<p>But Neaera said to herself, when she was
alone, &ldquo;I think that was right. But, oh
dear, oh dear! what a fuss about&rdquo;&mdash;she
paused, and added&mdash;&ldquo;nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And even if it were not quite nothing,
if it were even as much as a pair of
shoes, the effect did threaten to be greatly
out of proportion to the cause. Old Dawkins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and the fussy clerk, and the fat policeman
could never have thought of such a
coil as this, or surely, in defiance of all the
laws of the land, they would have let that
nameless damsel go.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="f8">A SERPENT IN EDEN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">On</span> mature reflection, Gerald Neston declined
to be angry. At first, when he had heard
George&rsquo;s tale, he had been moved to wrath,
and had said bitter things about reckless
talking, and even about malicious backbiting.
But really, when you came to look
at it, the thing was too absurd&mdash;not worth a
moment&rsquo;s consideration&mdash;except that it had,
of course, annoyed Neaera, and must, of
course, leave some unpleasantness behind it.
Poor old George! he had hunted up a
mare&rsquo;s nest this time, and no mistake. No
doubt he couldn&rsquo;t marry a thief; but who in
his sober senses would attach any importance
to this tale? George had done what he was
pleased to think his duty. Let it rest. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he saw his folly, Neaera would forgive him,
like the sweet girl she was. In fact, Gerald
pooh-poohed the whole thing, and not the
less because he had, not unnaturally, expected
an accusation of quite another character,
more unforgivable because not so outrageously
improbable and wild.</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury could not consent to treat
what he described as &ldquo;the incident&rdquo; in quite
so cavalier a fashion. He did not spare his
hearers the well-worn precedent of Caesar&rsquo;s
wife; and although, after an interview with
Neaera, he was convinced of her innocence, it
was in his opinion highly desirable that
George should disabuse his own mind of this
strange notion by some investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage, in any case, will not take
place for three months. Go and convince
yourself of your mistake, and then, my dear
George, we will make your peace with the
lady. I need not caution you to let the
matter go no further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To be treated as a well-intentioned but
misguided person is the most exasperating
thing in the world, and George had hard
work to keep his temper under the treatment.
But he recognised that he might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have fared worse, and, in truth, he asked no
more than a suspension of the marriage pending
inquiry&mdash;a concession that he understood
Lord Tottlebury was prepared to make,
though proof must, of course, be forthcoming
in reasonable time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel bound to look into it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;As I have begun it, I will spare no pains.
Nobody wishes more heartily than myself
that I may have made an ass of myself.&rdquo;
And he really did come as near to this
laudable state of mind as it is in human
nature to come.</p>

<p>Before the conference broke up, Lord
Tottlebury suggested that there was one
thing George could do at once&mdash;he could
name the date of the trial at Peckton. George
kept no diary, but he knew that the fateful
expedition had been among his earliest professional
journeys after his call to the Bar.
Only very junior men went to Peckton,
and, according to his recollection, the occurrence
took place in the April following
his call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;April, eight years ago, was the time,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pledge myself to a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You pledge yourself to the month?&rdquo;
asked his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to the month, and I dare say I shall
be able to find the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will you go to Peckton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday. I can&rsquo;t possibly before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interview took place on the Tuesday
evening, and on Wednesday Gerald went to
lay the state of affairs before Neaera.</p>

<p>Neaera was petulant, scornful, almost
flippant. More than all this, she was
mysterious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. George Neston has his reasons,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;He will not withdraw his accusation.
I know he will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest, George is a first-rate fellow,
as honourable as the day. If he finds&mdash;rather,
when he finds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Neaera said was, &ldquo;Honourable!&rdquo; But
she put a great deal into that one word.
&ldquo;You dear, simple fellow!&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;you have no suspicions of anybody. But
let him take care how he persists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than this could not be got out of her,
but she spoke freely about her own supposed
misdoings, pouring a flood of ridicule and
bitterness on George&rsquo;s unhappy head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A fool you call him!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in
reply to Gerald&rsquo;s half-hearted defence. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a fool, but I hope he is no
worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s getting it so precious warm, Mrs.
Witt?&rdquo; inquired Tommy Myles&rsquo;s cheerful
voice. &ldquo;The door was ajar, and your words
forced themselves&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Myles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you&rsquo;d invited me, and your servant
wasn&rsquo;t about, the porter-fellow told me to
walk up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you did. There&rsquo;s nothing
you can&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Neaera!&rdquo; Gerald hastily
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he hear?&rdquo; demanded
Neaera, turning on him in superb indignation.
&ldquo;Are you afraid that he&rsquo;ll believe
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but we all thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant Mr. George Neston,&rdquo; said Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George!&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you why.&rdquo; And, in spite
of Gerald&rsquo;s protest, she poured her tale of
wrong into Tommy&rsquo;s sympathetic and wide-opened
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There! Don&rsquo;t tell any one else. Lord
Tottlebury says we mustn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t mind,
for myself, who knows it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy was overwhelmed. His mind refused
to act. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lunatic!&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s safe to live with him.
He&rsquo;ll cut my throat, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; his lunacy is under control&mdash;a
well-trained, obedient lunacy,&rdquo; said Neaera,
relapsing into mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all hope,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll soon
find out his mistake, and nothing need come
of it. Keep your mouth shut, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m silent as the cold tomb.
But I&rsquo;m da&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some more tea?&rdquo; said Neaera,
smiling very graciously. Should she not
reward so warm a champion?</p>

<p>When the two young men took their leave
and walked away together, Tommy vied
even with Gerald in the loudness of his indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lie! Of course it is, though I don&rsquo;t
mean that old George don&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;the
old ass! Why, the mere fact of her insisting
on telling me about it is enough. She
wouldn&rsquo;t do that if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; assented Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be all for hushing it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald agreed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s purely for George&rsquo;s sake we are so
keen to keep it quiet,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Though,
of course, Neaera even wouldn&rsquo;t want it all
over the town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;d better tell George I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. You&rsquo;ll be bound to show it
in your manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George showed no astonishment at hearing
that Neaera had made a confidant of Tommy
Myles. It was quite consistent with the
part she was playing, as he conceived it.
Nor did he resent Tommy&rsquo;s outspoken
rebukes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mix yourself up in unpleasant
things when you aren&rsquo;t obliged, my son,&rdquo; was
all he said in reply to these tirades. &ldquo;Dine
at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; snorted Tommy, in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t break bread with the likes
of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the play, and to supper
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eunice Beauchamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, what a pretty name!&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;Short for &lsquo;Betsy Jones,&rsquo; I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the devil,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t going to accuse her of prigging, are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She kidnaps little boys,&rdquo; said George,
who felt himself entitled to some revenge,
&ldquo;and keeps them till they&rsquo;re nearly grown
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you ever saw her in
your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I did&mdash;first piece I ever went
to, twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, what with Eunice Beauchamp,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i> Betsy Jones, and Neaera Witt, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</i>&mdash;what?&mdash;two
friends parted for that evening
with some want of cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She plays a bold game,&rdquo; thought George,
as he ate his solitary chop; &ldquo;but too bold.
You overdo it, Mrs. Witt. An innocent girl
would not tell that sort of thing to a stranger,
however false it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which reflection only showed that things
strike different minds differently.</p>

<p>George needed comfort. The Serpent-in-Eden
feeling was strong upon him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wanted somebody who would not only
recognise his integrity but also admire his
discretion. He had a card for Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s
at-home, and Isabel was to be there.
He would go and have a talk with her;
perhaps he would tell her all about it, for
surely Neaera&rsquo;s confidence to Tommy Myles
absolved him from the strict letter of his
pledge of secrecy. Isabel was a sensible
girl; she would understand his position, and
not look on him as a cross between an idiot
and a burglar because he had done what
was obviously right. So George went to
Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s with all the rest of the
world; for everybody went there. Mrs.
Pocklington&mdash;Eleanor Fitzderham, who
married Pocklington, the great shipowner,
member for Dockborough&mdash;had done more
to unite the classes and the masses than
hundreds of philanthropic societies, and, it
may be added, in a pleasanter manner; and
if, at her parties, the bigwigs did not always
talk to the littlewigs, yet the littlewigs were
in the same room with the bigwigs, which is
something even at the moment, and really
very nearly as good for purposes of future
reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>George made his way across the crowded
rooms, recognising many acquaintances as
he went. There was Mr. Blodwell talking
to the last new beauty&mdash;he had a wonderful
knack of it,&mdash;and Sidmouth Vane talking to
the last new heiress, who would refuse him
in a month or two. An atheistic philosopher
was discussing the stagnation of the stock-markets
with a high-church Bishop&mdash;Mrs.
Pocklington always aimed at starting people
on their points of common interest: and Lady
Wheedleton, of the Primrose League, was
listening to Professor Dressingham&rsquo;s description
of the newest recipe for manure, with
an impression that the subject was not quite
decent, but might be useful at elections.
General Sir Thomas Swears was asking if
anybody had seen the Secretary for War&mdash;he
had a word to say to him about the last
rifle; but nobody had. The Countess Hilda
von Someveretheim was explaining the
problem of &ldquo;Darkest England&rdquo; to the
Minister of the Republic of Compostella;
Judge Cutter, the American mystic, was
asking the captain of the Oxford Boat Club
about the philosophy of Hegel, and Miss Zoe
Ballance, the pretty actress, was discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the relations of art and morality with Colonel
Belamour of the Guards.</p>

<p>George was inclined to resent the air of
general enjoyment that pervaded the place:
it seemed a little unfeeling. But he was
comforted by catching sight of Isabel. She
was talking to a slight young man who wore
an eye-glass and indulged in an expression
of countenance which invited the conclusion
that he was overworked and overstrained.
Indeed, he was just explaining to Miss Bourne
that it was not so much long hours as what
he graphically described as the &ldquo;tug on his
nerves&rdquo; that wore him out. Isabel had never
suffered from this particular torture, but she
was very sympathetic, said that she had
often heard the same from other literary
men (which was true), and promised to go
down to supper with Mr. Espion later in
the evening. Mr. Espion went about his
business (for, the fact is, he was &ldquo;doing&rdquo; the
party for the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>), and the coast
was left clear for George, who came up
with a deliberately lugubrious air. Of course
Isabel asked him what was the matter; and,
somehow or other, it happened that in less
than ten minutes she was in possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
all the material facts, if they were facts,
concerning Neaera Witt and the pair of
shoes.</p>

<p>The effect was distinctly disappointing.
Amiability degenerates into simplicity when
it leads to the refusal to accept obvious facts
merely because they impugn the character of
an acquaintance; and what is the use of
feminine devotion if it boggles over accepting
what you say, just because you say something
a little surprising? George was much
annoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not mistaken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did not
speak hastily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;But&mdash;but
you have no actual proof, have you,
George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet; but I soon shall have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, unless you get it very soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to withdraw what you
have said, and apologise to Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact, you think I was wrong to speak
at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should have waited till I had
proof; and then, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody seems to think me an ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not <em>that</em>, George; but a little&mdash;well&mdash;reckless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t withdraw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you get no proof?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George shirked this pointed question, and,
as the interview was really less soothing than
he had expected, took an early opportunity
of escaping.</p>

<p>Mr. Espion came back, and asked why
Neston had gone away looking so sulky.
Isabel smiled and said Mr. Neston was vexed
with her. Could anybody be vexed with
Miss Bourne? asked Mr. Espion, and added,</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Neston is rather crotchety, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked Isabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Well, the fact is,
I was talking to Tommy Myles at the
Cancan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, Mr. Espion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the theatre, and he told me Neston
had got some maggot in his head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ought to say
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But need we listen longer? And whose
fault was it&mdash;Neaera&rsquo;s, or George&rsquo;s, or
Isabel&rsquo;s, or Tommy&rsquo;s, or Mr. Espion&rsquo;s? That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
became the question afterwards, when Lord
Tottlebury was face to face with the violated
compact,&mdash;and with next day&rsquo;s issue of the
<cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f8">THE FIRST PARAGRAPH&mdash;AND OTHERS.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Under</span> pressure of circumstances men very
often do what they have declared they cannot
possibly do; it happens with private individuals
no less than with political parties.
George declared he could not possibly go to
Peckton before Saturday; but he was so
disgusted with his position, that he threw all
other engagements to the winds, and started
early on Thursday morning, determined not
to face his friends again without attempting
to prove his words. Old Dawkins was dead,
but the clerk was, and the policeman might
be, alive; and, on his return to town, he
could see Jennings, the clerk&rsquo;s son, who had
settled down to conveyancing in Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn, and try to refresh his memory with
materials gathered on the spot. For George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had already seen Mr. Jennings, and Mr.
Jennings remembered nothing about it&mdash;it
was not his first brief,&mdash;but was willing to
try to recall the matter if George would get
him the details and let him see a picture of
the person wanted&mdash;a request George did not
wish to comply with at the moment.</p>

<p>So he went to Peckton, and found out
perhaps as much as he could reasonably
expect to find out, as shall in due course
appear. And during his absence several
things happened. In the first place, the
<cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite> was published, containing what
became known as the &ldquo;First Paragraph.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;First Paragraph&rdquo; was headed &ldquo;Strange
Charge against a Lady&mdash;Rumoured Proceedings,&rdquo;
and indicated the Neston family,
Neaera Witt, and George, in such a manner
as to enable their friends to identify them.
This paragraph was inserted with the object
of giving Neaera, or George, or both of them,
as the case might be, or anybody else who
could be &ldquo;drawn,&rdquo; an opportunity of contradicting
it. The second event was that the
Nestons&rsquo; friends did identify them, and proceeded
to open the minds of everybody who
did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mr. Blodwell read the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>,
as his custom was, and thoughtfully ejaculated
&ldquo;Peckton!&rdquo; and Lord Tottlebury,
being at the club, was shown the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>
by a friend, who really could not do less, and
went home distracted; and Tommy Myles
read it, and, conscience-stricken, fled to
Brighton for three days&rsquo; fresh air; and
Isabel read it, and confessed to her mother,
and was scolded, and cried; and Gerald read
it, and made up his mind to kick everybody
concerned, except, of course, Neaera;
and, finally, Neaera read it, and was rather
frightened and rather excited, and girt on
her armour for battle.</p>

<p>Gerald, however, was conscious that the
process he had in his mind, satisfying as it
would be to his own feelings, would not
prove in all respects a solution of the difficulty,
and, with the selfishness which a crisis
in a man&rsquo;s own affairs engenders, he made
no scruple about taking up a full hour of Mr.
Blodwell&rsquo;s time, and expounding his views
at great length, under the guise of taking
counsel. Mr. Blodwell listened to his narrative
of facts with interest, but cut short his
stream of indignant comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The mischief is that it&rsquo;s got into the
papers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But for that, I don&rsquo;t see
that it matters much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not matter much?&rdquo; gasped Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s true
or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s life or death to me,&rdquo; answered Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bosh! She won&rsquo;t steal any more shoes
now she&rsquo;s a rich woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak, sir, as if you thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t any opinion on the subject, and
it wouldn&rsquo;t be of any importance if I had.
The question is shortly this: Supposing it to
be true, would you marry her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald flung himself into a chair, and bit
his finger nail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight years is a long while ago; and
poverty&rsquo;s a hard thing; and she&rsquo;s a pretty
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absurd hypothesis,&rdquo; said Gerald.
&ldquo;But a thief&rsquo;s a thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True. So are a good many other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have to consider my father and&mdash;and
the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you? I should see the family
damned. However, it comes to this&mdash;if it
were true, you wouldn&rsquo;t marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; groaned Gerald. &ldquo;We
should be cut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my ardent lover,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
being so, you&rsquo;d better do nothing till you see
whether it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I only took the hypothesis;
but I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt that it&rsquo;s a
lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mistake&mdash;yes. But it&rsquo;s in the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>,
and a mistake in the newspapers needs
to be reckoned with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till George comes back. Meanwhile,
hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall contradict that lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better not. Don&rsquo;t write to them,
or see them, or let anybody else till George
comes back. And, Gerald, if I were you, I
shouldn&rsquo;t quarrel with George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall withdraw it, or prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell shrugged his shoulders and
became ostentatiously busy with the case of
<i>Pigg</i> <abbr title="versus">v.</abbr> <i>the Local Board of Slushton-under-Mudd</i>.
&ldquo;A very queer point this,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;The drainage system of Slushton
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he stopped with a chuckle at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the sight of Gerald&rsquo;s vanishing back. He
called after him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to Mrs. Witt&rsquo;s this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Gerald. &ldquo;This evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell sat at work for ten minutes
more. Then he rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Neston gone, Timms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then get a four-wheeler.&rdquo; And he
added to himself, &ldquo;I should like to see her
again, under this new light. I wonder if
she&rsquo;ll let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera did let him in. In fact, she seemed
very glad to see him, and accepted with
meekness her share of his general censure
on the &ldquo;babbling&rdquo; that had gone on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, handing him a cup
of tea, &ldquo;it scarcely seemed a serious matter
to me. I was angry, of course, but almost
more amused than angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; answered Mr. Blodwell.
&ldquo;But, my dear young lady, everything which
is public is serious. And this thing is now
public, for no doubt to-morrow&rsquo;s <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>
will give all your names and addresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Neaera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell shook his head. &ldquo;You must
consider Gerald and his people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald doesn&rsquo;t doubt me. If he did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Neaera left her recreant lover&rsquo;s fate to the
imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Lord Tottlebury and the world at
large? The world at large always doubts
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Neaera, sadly. &ldquo;Fortunately,
I have conclusive proof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Witt, why didn&rsquo;t you say
so before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before there was anything to meet? Is
that your way, Mr. Blodwell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George may bring back something to
meet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera rose and went to her writing-table.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I shouldn&rsquo;t show it to
you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was just going to send
it to Lord Tottlebury. It will be a pleasant
surprise for Mr. George Neston when he
comes back from Peckton with his proofs!&rdquo;
She handed Mr. Blodwell a sheet of note-paper.</p>

<p>He took it, throwing one quick glance at
Neaera. &ldquo;You wish me to read this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s letting you into the secrets of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
early days,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see, I wasn&rsquo;t
always as well off as I am now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell adjusted his eye-glass and
perused the document, which set forth that
Miss N. Gale entered the service of Mrs.
Philip Horne, of Balmoral Villa, Bournemouth,
as companion to that lady, in March,
1883, and remained in such service until the
month of July, 1883; that, during the whole
of such period, she conducted herself with
propriety; that she read aloud with skill,
ordered a household with discretion, and
humoured a fussy old lady with tact (this is
a paraphrase of the words of the writer);
finally, that she left, by her own desire, to
the regret of the above-mentioned Susan
Horne.</p>

<p>Neaera watched Mr. Blodwell as he read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteen eighty-three?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the year in question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and April is the month in question&mdash;the
month I am supposed to have spent in
prison!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t show this to George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why should I? Besides, I didn&rsquo;t
know then when he dated my crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell thought it a little queer that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
she had not asked him. &ldquo;He should certainly
see it at once. Have you seen anything of
Mrs. Horne lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; I should be afraid she must be
dead. She was an old lady, and very feeble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;it may be&mdash;very lucky&mdash;your
having this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it? I should never have remembered
the exact time I went to Mrs.
Horne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell took his departure in a state
of mind that he felt was unreasonable. Neaera
had been, he told himself, most frank, most
charming, most satisfactory. Yet he was
possessed with an overpowering desire to
cross-examine Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s only habit,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;A protestation of innocence raises all
my fighting instincts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day witnessed the publication
of the &ldquo;Second Paragraph,&rdquo; and the second
paragraph made it plain to everybody that
somebody must vindicate his or her character.
The public did not care who did it, but it felt
itself entitled to an action, wherein the whole
matter should be threshed out for the furtherance
of public justice and entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite> itself took this view. It implored
Neaera, or George, or somebody to
sue it, if they would not sue one another. It
had given names, addresses, dates, and details.
Could the most exacting plaintiff ask more?
If no action were brought, it was clear that
Neaera had stolen the shoes, and that George
had slandered her, and that the Nestons in
general shrank from investigation into the
family history; all this was still clearer, if
they pursued their extraordinary conduct in
not forwarding personal narratives for the
information of the public and the accommodation
of the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.</p>

<p>Into this turmoil George was plunged on
his return from Peckton. He had been
detained there two days, and did not reach
his rooms till late on Friday evening. He
was greeted by two numbers of the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>,
neatly displayed on his table; by a fiery
epistle from Gerald, demanding blood or
apologies; by two penitential dirges from
Isabel Bourne and Tommy Myles; and, lastly,
by a frigid note from Lord Tottlebury, enclosing
the testimony of Mrs. Philip Horne
to the character and accomplishments of Miss
N. Gale. In Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s opinion, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
one course was, under the circumstances,
open to a gentleman.</p>

<p>Philanthropists often remark, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of
other philanthropists, that it is easier to do
harm than good, even when you are, as it
were, an expert in doing good. George
began to think that his amateur effort at
preserving the family reputation and punishing
a wrongdoer looked like vindicating
the truth of this general principle. Here
was a hornets&rsquo;-nest about his ears! And
would what he brought back with him make
the buzzing less furious or the stings less
active? He thought not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can a girl be in two places at once,&rdquo; he
asked,&mdash;&ldquo;in one of her Majesty&rsquo;s prisons,
and also at&mdash;where is it?&mdash;Balmoral Villa,
Bournemouth?&rdquo; And he laid side by side
Mrs. Horne&rsquo;s letter and a certain photograph
which was among the spoils of his expedition.</p>

<p>George had not the least doubt that it was
a photograph of Neaera Witt, for all that
it was distinctly inscribed, &ldquo;Nelly Game.&rdquo;
Beyond all question it was a photograph of
the girl who stole the shoes, thoughtfully
taken and preserved with a view to protecting
society against future depredations at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hands. It was Crown property, George supposed,
and probably he had no business with
it, but a man can get many things he has no
business with for half a sovereign, the sum
George had paid for the loan of it. It must
be carefully remembered that Peckton is
exceptional, not typical, in the laxity of its
administration, and a long reign of solitary
despotism had sapped the morality of the fat
policeman.</p>

<p>The art of photography has made much
progress in recent years. It is less an engine
for the reduction of self-conceit than it used
to be, and less a means of revealing how
ill-looking a given person can appear under
favourable circumstances. But Peckton was
behind the time, here as everywhere. Nelly
Game&rsquo;s portrait did faint justice to Neaera
Witt, and eight years&rsquo; wear had left it
blurred and faded almost to the point of
indistinctness. It was all very well for
George to recognise it. In candour he was
bound to admit that he doubted if it would
convince the unwilling. Besides, a great
change comes between seventeen and five-and-twenty,
even when Seventeen is not half-starved
and clad in rags, Five-and-twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
living in luxury, and decked in the glories
of millinery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it will
help. Let&rsquo;s have a look at this&mdash;document.&rdquo;
When he had read it he whistled gently.
&ldquo;Oh, ho! an alibi. Now I&rsquo;ve got her!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>But had he? He carefully re-read the
letter. It was a plausible enough letter, and
conclusive, unless he was prepared to charge
Mrs. Witt with deeper schemes and more
dangerous accomplishments than he had yet
thought of doing.</p>

<p>Men are mistaken sometimes, said a voice
within him; but he would not listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look at that again to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and find out who &lsquo;Susan Horne&rsquo; is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he read his letters, and cursed his
luck, and went to bed a miserable man.</p>

<p>The presentment of truth, not the inculcation
of morality, being the end of art, it is
worth while to remark that he went to bed
a miserable man simply and solely because
he had tried to do his duty.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="f8">A SUCCESSFUL ORDEAL.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> general opinion was that Gerald Neston
behaved foolishly in allowing himself to be
interviewed by the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>. Indeed, it
is rather odd, when we consider the almost
universal disapproval of the practice of interviewing,
to see how frequent interviews are.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Damnantur et crescunt</i>; and mankind agrees
to excuse its own weakness by postulating
irresistible ingenuity and audacity in the
interviewer. So Gerald was publicly blamed
and privately blessed for telling the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>
that an atrocious accusation had been
brought against the lady referred to, and
brought by one who should have been the
last to bring it, and would, he hoped, be the
first to withdraw it. The accusation did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
seriously concern the lady&rsquo;s character, and
nothing but the fullest apology could be
accepted. He preferred not to go into details
at present; indeed, he hoped it would never
be necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Such might be Gerald&rsquo;s hope. It was not
the hope of the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>, nor, indeed, of
society in general. What could be more
ill-advised than to hint dreadful things and
refuse full information? Such a course
simply left the imagination to wander, fancy
free, through the Newgate Calendar, attributing
to Mrs. Witt&mdash;the name of the
slandered lady was by this time public
property&mdash;all or any of the actions therein
recorded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a blank bill,&rdquo; said Charters, the
commercial lawyer, to Mr. Blodwell; &ldquo;you
fill it up for as much as the stamp will
cover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more gossiping fool you,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Blodwell, very rudely, and quite unjustifiably,
for the poor man merely meant
to indicate a natural tendency, not to declare
his own idea of what was proper. But Mr.
Blodwell was cross; everybody had made
fools of themselves, he thought, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hanged&mdash;at least hanged&mdash;if he saw his way
out of it.</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s name had not as yet been actually
mentioned, but everybody knew who it was,&mdash;that
&ldquo;relative of Lord Tottlebury, whose
legal experience, if nothing else, should have
kept him from bringing ungrounded accusations;&rdquo;
and George&rsquo;s position was far from
pleasant. He began to see, or fancy he saw,
men looking askance at him; his entrance
was the occasion of a sudden pause in conversation;
his relations with his family were,
it need hardly be said, intolerable to the
last degree; and, finally, Isabel Bourne had
openly gone over to the enemy, had made
her mother invite Neaera Witt to dinner,
and had passed George in the park with the
merest mockery of a bow. He was anxious
to bring matters to an issue one way or
another, and with this end he wrote to Lord
Tottlebury, asking him to arrange a meeting
with Mrs. Witt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been
to Peckton. I have already told you what I
found there, so far as it bore on the fact of
&lsquo;Nelly Game&rsquo;s&rsquo; conviction. I now desire to
give certain persons who were acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
with &lsquo;Nelly Game&rsquo; an opportunity of seeing
Mrs. Witt. No doubt she will raise no
objections. Blodwell is willing to put his
chambers at our disposal; and I think this
would be the best place, as it will avoid the
gossip and curiosity of the servants. Will
Mrs. Witt name a day and time? I and my
companions will make a point of suiting her
convenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s &ldquo;companions&rdquo; were none other
than the fussy clerk and the fat policeman.
The female warder had vanished; and
although there were some prison officials
whose office dated from before Nelly Game&rsquo;s
imprisonment, George felt that, unless his
first two witnesses were favourable, it would
be useless to press the matter, and did not
at present enlist their services. Mr. Jennings,
the Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn barrister, had proved
utterly hopeless. George showed him the
photograph. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have recognized
it from Eve&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings; and
George felt that he might, without duplicity,
ignore such a useless witness.</p>

<p>Neaera laughed a little at the proposal
when it was submitted to her, but expressed
her willingness to consent to it. Gerald was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
almost angry with her for not being angry
at the indignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He goes too far: upon my word he
does;&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter, dear?&rdquo; asked
Neaera. &ldquo;It will be rather fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury raised a hand in grave
protest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Neaera!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much fun for George,&rdquo; Gerald remarked
in grim triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s chambers will
do?&rdquo; asked Lord Tottlebury. &ldquo;It seems
convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here Neaera, rather to his surprise,
had her own views. She wasn&rsquo;t going down
to musty chambers to be stared at&mdash;yes,
Gerald, all lawyers stared,&mdash;and taken for
a breach-of-promise person, and generally
besmirched with legal mire. No: nor she
wouldn&rsquo;t have Mr. George Neston&rsquo;s spies in
her house; nor would she put herself out the
least about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it must be in my house,&rdquo; said Lord
Tottlebury.</p>

<p>Neaera acquiesced, merely adding that the
valuables had better be locked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And when? We had better say some
afternoon, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am engaged every afternoon for a
fortnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Lord Tottlebury, &ldquo;business
must take precedence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera did not see it; but at last she made
a suggestion. &ldquo;I am dining with you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
famille</i> the day after to-morrow. Let them
come then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Ten minutes
after dinner will settle the whole business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury made no objection. George
had suggested that a couple of other ladies
should be present, to make the trial fairer;
and it was decided to invite Isabel Bourne,
and Miss Laura Pocklington, daughter of the
great Mrs. Pocklington. Mrs. Pocklington
would come with her daughter, and it was
felt that her presence would add authority to
the proceedings. Maud Neston was away;
indeed, her absence had been thought desirable,
pending the settlement of this unpleasant
affair.</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury always made the most of
his chances of solemnity, and, if left to his
own bent, would have invested the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
occasion with an impressiveness not far short
of a death sentence. But he was powerless in
face of the determined frivolity with which
Neaera treated the whole matter. Mrs.
Pocklington found herself, apparently, invited
to assist at a farce, instead of a melodrama,
and with her famous tact at once recognised
the situation, her elaborate playfulness
sanctioned the hair-brained chatter of the
girls, and made Gerald&rsquo;s fierce indignation
seem disproportionate to the subject. Dinner
passed in a whirl of jokes and gibes, George
affording ample material; and afterwards the
ladies, flushed with past laughter, and constantly
yielding to fresh hilarity at Neaera&rsquo;s
sallies, awaited the coming of George and
his party with no diminution of gaiety.</p>

<p>A knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are the minions of the law, Mrs.
Witt!&rdquo; cried Laura Pocklington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must prepare for the dungeon,&rdquo;
said Neaera, and rearranged her hair before
a mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It quite reminds me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington,
&ldquo;of the dear Queen of Scots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury was, in spite of his preoccupations,
beginning to argue about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
propriety of Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s epithet,
when George was shown in. He looked
weary, bored, disgusted. After shaking
hands with Lord Tottlebury, he bowed
generally to the room, and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose to bring Mr. Jennings, the
clerk, in first; then the policeman. It will
be better they should come separately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury nodded. Gerald had
ostentatiously turned his back on his cousin.
Mrs. Pocklington fanned herself with an air
of amused protest, which the girls reproduced
in a broader form. No one spoke,
till Neaera herself said with a laugh,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrange your effects as you please, Mr.
Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George looked at her. She was dressed
with extraordinary richness, considering the
occasion. Her neck and arms, disclosed by
her evening gown, glittered with diamonds;
a circlet of the same stones adorned her
golden hair, which was arranged in a lofty
erection on her head. She met his look
with derisive defiance, smiling in response
to the sarcastic smile on his face. George&rsquo;s
smile was called forth by the recognition of
his opponent&rsquo;s tactics. Her choice of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and place had enabled her to call to her aid
all the arts of millinery and the resources
of wealth to dazzle and blind the eyes of
those who sought to find in her the shabby
draggle-tailed girl of eight years before.
Old Mr. Jennings had come under strong
protest. He was, he said, half blind eight
years ago, and more than half now; he
had seen hundreds of interesting young
criminals and could no more recognise one
from another than to-day&rsquo;s breakfast egg
from yesterday week&rsquo;s; as for police photographs,
everybody knew they only darkened
truth. Still he came, because George had
constrained him.</p>

<p>Neaera, Isabel, and Laura Pocklington
took their places side by side, Neaera on
the right, leaning her arm on the chimney-piece,
in her favourite pose of languid
haughtiness; Isabel was next her. Lord
Tottlebury met Mr. Jennings with cold
civility, and gave him a chair. The old
man wiped his spectacles and put them on.
A pause ensued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; said Lord Tottlebury, &ldquo;I suppose
you have explained?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Mr. Jennings, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
you say whether any, and which, of the
persons present is Nelly Game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald turned round to watch the trial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the person suspected&mdash;supposed to
be Nelly Game&mdash;in the room?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Jennings, with some surprise. He
had expected to see a group of maid-servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Lord Tottlebury, with
a grim smile. And Mrs. Pocklington
chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I certainly can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Jennings.
And there was an end of that, an
end no other than what George had expected.
The fat policeman was his sheet-anchor.</p>

<p>The fat policeman, or to give him his
proper name, Sergeant Stubbs, unlike Mr.
Jennings, was enjoying himself. A trip to
London <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</i>, with expenses on a liberal
scale, and an identification at the end&mdash;could
the heart of mortal constable desire more?
Know the girl? Of course he would, among
a thousand! It was his business to know
people and he did not mean to fail, especially
in the service of so considerate an employer.
So he walked in confidently, sat himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
down, and received his instructions with
professional imperturbability.</p>

<p>The ladies stood and smiled at Stubbs.
Stubbs sat and peered at the ladies, and,
being a man at heart, thought they were
a set of as likely girls as he&rsquo;d ever seen; so
he told Mrs. Stubbs afterwards. But which
was Nelly Game?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her in the middle,&rdquo; said Stubbs,
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t trouble
Miss Bourne any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isabel went and sat down, with a scornful
toss of her head, and Laura Pocklington and
Neaera stood side by side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as if it were the judgment
of Paris,&rdquo; whispered the latter, audibly,
and Mrs. Pocklington and Gerald tittered.
Stubbs had once been to Paris on business,
but he did not see what it had to do
with the present occasion, unless indeed
it were something about a previous conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t her,&rdquo; he said, after another
pause, pointing a stumpy forefinger at Laura
Pocklington.</p>

<p>There was a little shiver of dismay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
George rigidly repressed every indication of
satisfaction. Neaera stood calm and smiling,
bending a look of amused kindliness on
Stubbs; but the palm of the white hand
on the mantelpiece grew pink as the white
fingers pressed against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see me a little
nearer?&rdquo; she asked, and, stepping forward
to where Stubbs sat, she stood right in front
of him.</p>

<p>George felt inclined to cry &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; as
if he were at the play.</p>

<p>Stubbs was puzzled. There was a likeness,
but there was so much unlikeness too. It
really wasn&rsquo;t fair to dress people up differently.
How was a man to know
them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might I see the photograph again, sir?&rdquo;
he asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; exclaimed Gerald, angrily.</p>

<p>George ignored him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had rather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you told us
what you think without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George had sent Lord Tottlebury the
photograph, and everybody had looked at
it and declared it was not the least like
Neaera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Stubbs resumed his survey. At last he
said, pressing his hand over his eyes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swear to her, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Neaera laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear to me, Mr. Stubbs!&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;But do you mean you think I&rsquo;m like this
Nelly Games?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Game,&rsquo; not &lsquo;Games,&rsquo; Mrs. Witt,&rdquo; said
George, smiling again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, &lsquo;Game.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, you&rsquo;ve a look of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she has,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington,
&ldquo;or Mr. George would never have
made the mistake.&rdquo; Mrs. Pocklington liked
George, and wanted to let him down
easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you can say?&rdquo; asked Lord
Tottlebury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I mean, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It comes to nothing,&rdquo; said Lord Tottlebury,
decisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Thank
you, Stubbs. I&rsquo;ll join you and Mr. Jennings
in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Stubbs,&rdquo; said Neaera.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should have known you if I&rsquo;d
ever seen you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stubbs withdrew, believing himself to
have received a compliment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course this ends the matter, George,&rdquo;
said Lord Tottlebury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; said Gerald.</p>

<p>George looked at Neaera; and as he
looked the conviction grew stronger on him
that she was Nelly Game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. George Neston is not convinced,&rdquo;
said she, mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not much matter whether I am
convinced or not,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;There is
no kind of evidence to prove the identity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald sprang up in indignation. &ldquo;Do
you mean that you won&rsquo;t retract?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can state all the facts; I shall say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall apologise, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald,&rdquo; said Lord Tottlebury, &ldquo;this is
no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a feeling that George was behaving
very badly. Everybody thought so,
and said so; and all except Neaera either
exhorted or besought him to confess himself
the victim of an absurd mistake. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
matter had become public, nothing less could
be accepted.</p>

<p>George wavered. &ldquo;I will let you know
to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Meanwhile let me
return this document to Mrs. Witt.&rdquo; He
took out Mrs. Horne&rsquo;s letter and laid it on
the table. &ldquo;I have ventured to take a
copy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As the original is valuable,
I thought I had better give it
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Neaera, and moved
forward to take it.</p>

<p>Gerald hastened to fetch it for her. As
he took it up, his eye fell on the writing,
for George had laid it open on the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Neaera,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in your
handwriting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George started, and he thought he saw
Neaera start just perceptibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a
copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you never told me so,&rdquo; said
Lord Tottlebury; &ldquo;and I have never seen
your handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald and Maud have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they never saw this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was stupid of me,&rdquo; said Neaera, penitently;
&ldquo;but I never thought of there
being any mistake. What difference does it
make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s heart was hardened. He was
sure she had, if not tried to pass off the copy
as an original from the first, at any rate
taken advantage of the error.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you the original?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Neaera. &ldquo;I sent it to somebody
ever so long ago, and never got it
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you make this copy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I sent away the original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; began George again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; cried Gerald. &ldquo;You
shan&rsquo;t cross-examine her with your infernal
insinuations. Do you mean that she forged
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George grew stubborn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the original,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Gerald,
angrily.</p>

<p>George shrugged his shoulders, turned,
and left the room.</p>

<p>And they all comforted and cosseted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Neaera, and abused George, and made up
their minds to let the world know how badly
he was behaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our duty to society,&rdquo; said Lord
Tottlebury.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="f8">AN IMPOSSIBLE BARGAIN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;I should</span> eat humble-pie, George,&rdquo; said
Mr. Blodwell, tapping his eye-glasses against
his front teeth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one too many for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the whole, I incline to think you&rsquo;re
right. But I should eat humble-pie if I were
you, all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggested diet is palatable to nobody,
and the power of consuming it without
contortion is rightly put high in the list
of virtues, if virtue be proportionate to
difficulty. To a man of George Neston&rsquo;s
temperament penance was hard, even when
enforced by the consciousness of sin; to
bend the knees in abasement, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
soul was erect in self-approval, came nigh
impossibility.</p>

<p>Still it was unquestionably necessary that
he should assume the sheet and candle, or
put up with an alternative hardly, if at all,
less unpleasant. The &ldquo;Fourth Paragraph&rdquo;
had appeared. It was called a paragraph for
the sake of uniformity, but it was in reality
a narrative, stretching to a couple of columns,
and giving a detailed account of the attempted
identification. For once, George implicitly
believed the editor&rsquo;s statement that his information
came to him on unimpeachable
authority. The story was clearly not only
inspired by, but actually written by the hand
of Gerald himself, and it breathed a bitter
hostility to himself that grieved George none
the less because it was very natural. This
hostility showed itself, here and there, in
direct attack; more constantly in irony and
ingenious ridicule. George&rsquo;s look, manner,
tones, and walk were all pressed into the
service. In a word, the article certainly
made him look an idiot; he rather thought
it made him look a malignant idiot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Blodwell again. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bring up any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
more people from Peckton. You chose your
witnesses, and they let you in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went to Bournemouth, and you
found&mdash;what? Not that Mrs. What&rsquo;s-her-name&mdash;Horne&mdash;was
a myth, as you expected,
or conveniently&mdash;and, mind you, not unplausibly&mdash;dead,
as I expected, but an actual,
existent, highly respectable, though somewhat
doting, old lady. She had you badly
there, George my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted George. &ldquo;I wonder if
she knew the woman was alive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She chanced it; wished she might be
dead, perhaps, but chanced it. That, George,
is where Mrs. Witt is great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Horne doesn&rsquo;t remember her being
there in March, or indeed April.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; but she doesn&rsquo;t say the
contrary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. She said that if the character
says March, of course it was March.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;of course&rsquo; betrays a lay mind. But
still the character does say March&mdash;for what
it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The copy of it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean. But think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
before you say that, George. It&rsquo;s pretty
strong; and you haven&rsquo;t a tittle of evidence
to support you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say a word. I&rsquo;ll let
them alone, if they&rsquo;ll let me alone. But
that woman&rsquo;s Nelly Game, as sure as
I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An infernally obstinate chap,&rdquo; put in
Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>Probably what George meant by being
&ldquo;let alone,&rdquo; was the cessation of paragraphs
in the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>. If so, his wish was
not gratified. &ldquo;Will Mr. George Neston&rdquo;&mdash;George&rsquo;s
name was no longer &ldquo;withheld&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;retract?&rdquo;
took, in the columns of that
publication, much the position occupied by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delenda est Carthago</i> in the speeches of Cato
the Elder. It met the reader on the middle
page; it lurked for him in the leading
article; it appeared, by way of playful
reference, in the city intelligence; one man
declared he found it in an advertisement, but
this no doubt was an oversight&mdash;or perhaps
a lie.</p>

<p>George was not more sensitive than other
men, but the annoyance was extreme. The
whole world seemed full of people reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>, some with grave reprobation,
some with offensive chucklings.</p>

<p>But if the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite> would not leave him
alone, a large number of people did. He
was not exactly cut; but his invitations
diminished, the greetings he received grew
less cordial than of yore: he was not turned
out of the houses he went to, but he was not
much pressed to come again. He was made
to feel that right-minded and reasonable
people&mdash;a term everybody uses to describe
themselves&mdash;were against him, and that, if he
wished to re-enter the good graces of society,
he must do so by the strait and narrow
gate of penitence and apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to do it,&rdquo; he said to himself,
as he sat moodily in his chambers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
all at me&mdash;uncle Roger, Tommy Myles,
Isabel&mdash;all of them. I&rsquo;m shot if I ever
interfere with anybody&rsquo;s marriage again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The defection of Isabel rankled in his mind
worst of all. That she, of all people, should
turn against him, and, as a last insult, send
him upbraiding messages through Tommy
Myles! This she had done, and George was
full of wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A note for you, sir,&rdquo; said Timms, entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in his usual silent manner. Timms had
no views on the controversy, being one of
those rare people who mind their own business;
and George had fallen so low as to be
almost grateful for the colourless impartiality
with which he bore himself towards the
quarrel between his masters.</p>

<p>George took the note. &ldquo;Mr. Gerald been
here, Timms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked in for letters, sir; but went
away directly on hearing you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timms stated this fact as if it were in the
ordinary way of friendly intercourse, and
withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed George,
and paused.</p>

<p>The note was addressed in the handwriting
he now knew very well, the handwriting of
the Bournemouth character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Neston</span>,</p>

<p class="in">&ldquo;I shall be alone at five o&rsquo;clock
to-day. Will you come and see me?</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Neaera Witt.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;You must do as a lady asks you,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
George, &ldquo;even if she does steal shoes, and
you have mentioned it. Here goes! What&rsquo;s
she up to now, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera, arrayed in the elaborate carelessness
of a tea-gown, received him, not in the
drawing-room, but in her own snuggery.
Tea was on the table; there was a bright
little fire, and a somnolent old cat snoozed on
the hearth-rug. The whole air was redolent
of what advertisements called a &ldquo;refined
home,&rdquo; and Neaera&rsquo;s manner indicated an
almost pathetic desire to be friendly, checked
only by the self-respecting fear of a rude
rebuff to her advances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is really kind of you to come,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;to consent to a parley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beaten side always consents to
a parley,&rdquo; answered George, taking the
seat she indicated. She was half sitting,
half lying on a sofa when he came in,
and resumed her position after greeting
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said quickly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where
it&rsquo;s hard&mdash;when you&rsquo;re beaten. But do you
consider yourself beaten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to now, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you really are not convinced?&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
asked, eyeing him with a look of candid
appeal to his better nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your fault, Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why are you so hard to forget?&rdquo;
George thought there was no harm in
putting it in a pleasant way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, why was Miss&mdash;now is it Game or
Games?&mdash;so hard to forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, or rather was, Game. And I suppose
she was hard to forget for the same
reason as you&mdash;would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ask my cousin, no doubt he will
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What more can I do?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Your people didn&rsquo;t know me. I have
produced a letter showing I was somewhere
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, then, a copy of a letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What purports to be a copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am I&rsquo;m not a lawyer! It
seems to make people so suspicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity you didn&rsquo;t keep the
original.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Neaera said nothing. Perhaps she did not
agree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I suppose you didn&rsquo;t send for me to
argue about the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I sent for you to propose peace.
Mr. Neston, I am so weary of fighting. Why
will you make me fight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for my pleasure,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For whose, then?&rdquo; she asked, stretching
out her arms with a gesture of entreaty.
&ldquo;Cannot we say no more about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will admit you were wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is saying more about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot enjoy the position you are
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Neston, do you never think it&rsquo;s
possible you are wrong? But no, never
mind. Will you agree just to drop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heartily. But there&rsquo;s the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>! I&rsquo;ll go and
see the editor,&rdquo; said Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stern man, Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be so hard to deal with as you.
There, that&rsquo;s settled. Hurrah! Will you
shake hands, Mr. Neston?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you, thief or no thief. And I must
tell you you are very&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, above small resentments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what does it matter? Suppose I did
take the boots?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoes,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>Neaera burst into a laugh. &ldquo;You are
very accurate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are very inaccurate, Mrs.
Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall always be amused when I meet you.
I shall know you have your hand on your
watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. I retract nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera sat up and gave him her hand, and
the peace was ratified. But it so chanced
that Neaera&rsquo;s sudden movement roused the
cat. He yawned and got up, arching his
back, and digging his claws into the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Neaera, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t spoil the rug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s attention was directed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
animal, and, as he looked at it, he started.
Bob&rsquo;s change of posture had revealed a serious
deficiency: he had no tail, or the merest
apology for a tail.</p>

<p>It was certainly an odd coincidence, perhaps
nothing more, but a very odd coincidence,
that George should have seen in the courtyard
at Peckton Gaol no less than three tailless
cats! Of course there are a good many
in the world; but still most cats have tails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a black cat, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Neaera. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nice and Satanic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Peckton cats were black, too,&mdash;black as
ink or the heart of a money-lender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old favourite?&rdquo; asked George, insidiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had him a good many years. Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last word slipped from Neaera involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;oh!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten his milk,&rdquo; answered Neaera,
with extraordinary promptitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera was quite calm again. &ldquo;Some
friends gave him me. Please don&rsquo;t say I
stole my cat, too, Mr. Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George smiled; indeed, he almost laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, it is peace, Mrs. Witt,&rdquo; he said, taking
his hat. &ldquo;But remember!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Neaera, who was still smiling
and cordial, but rather less at her ease
than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cat may tell a tale, though he bear
none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is ever war again, I will tell you.
Good-bye, Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Please don&rsquo;t have poor Bob
arrested. He didn&rsquo;t steal the boots&mdash;oh, the
shoes, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect he was in prison already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera shook her head with an air of
bewilderment. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand
you. But I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re not enemies any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George departed, but Neaera sat down on
the rug and gazed into the fire. Presently
Bob came to look after the forgotten milk.
He rubbed himself right along Neaera&rsquo;s
elbow, beginning from his nose, down to the
end of what he called his tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Bob,&rdquo; said Neaera, &ldquo;what do you
want? Milk, dear? &lsquo;Good for evil, milk
for&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob purred and capered. Neaera gave
him his milk, and stood looking at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to be drowned,
dear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The unconscious Bob lapped on.</p>

<p>Neaera stamped her foot. &ldquo;He shan&rsquo;t!
He shan&rsquo;t! He shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Not an inch! Not an inch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bob finished his milk and looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear, you shan&rsquo;t be drowned. Don&rsquo;t
be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Bob knew nothing about drowning,
and only meant that he wanted more milk,
he showed no gratitude for his reprieve.
Indeed, seeing there was to be no more milk,
he pointedly turned his back, and began to
wash his face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE FRACAS AT MRS. POCKLINGTON&rsquo;S.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;I never</span> heard anything so absurd in all
my life,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell, with emphasis.</p>

<p>George had just informed him of the treaty
between himself and Neaera. He had told
his tale with some embarrassment. It is so
difficult to make people who were not present
understand how an interview came to take
the course it did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seemed to think it all right,&rdquo; George
said weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose you can shut people&rsquo;s
mouths in that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are other ways,&rdquo; remarked George,
grimly, for his temper began to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; assented Mr. Blodwell; &ldquo;and
in these days, if you use them, it&rsquo;s five pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
or a month, and a vast increase of gossip into
the bargain. What does Gerald say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose
Mrs. Witt can manage him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you? I doubt it. Gerald isn&rsquo;t over
easy to manage. Think of the position you
leave him in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He believes in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he won&rsquo;t be content unless other
people do. Of course they&rsquo;ll say she squared
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squared me!&rdquo; exclaimed George, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, I&rsquo;m not sure she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you can say what you please,
sir. From you I can&rsquo;t resent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be huffy. Bright eyes have
their effect on everybody. By the way, have
you seen Isabel Bourne lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard from her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sent me a message through Tommy
Myles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in her confidence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently. The effect of it was, that
she didn&rsquo;t want to see me till I had come to
my senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In those words?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those were Tommy&rsquo;s words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then relations are strained?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Bourne is the best judge of whom
she wishes to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell, cheerfully.
&ldquo;At present she seems to wish to see Myles.
Well, well, George, you&rsquo;ll have to come to
your knees at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Witt doesn&rsquo;t require it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald be&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;ve never told you
of my fresh evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re mad! What&rsquo;s in the wind
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later, George flung himself
angrily out of Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s chambers, leaving
that gentleman purple and palpitating
with laughter, as he gently re-echoed,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cat! Go to the jury on the cat,
George, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To George, in his hour of adversity, Mrs.
Pocklington was as a tower of strength. She
said that the Nestons might squabble among
themselves as much as they liked; it was no
business of hers. As for the affair getting
into the papers, her visiting-list would suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
considerably if she cut out everybody who
was wrongly or, she added significantly,
rightly abused in the papers. George Neston
might be mistaken, but he was an honest
young man, and for her part she thought
him an agreeable one&mdash;anyhow, a great deal
too good for that insipid child, Isabel Bourne.
If anybody didn&rsquo;t like meeting him at her
house, they could stay away. Poor Laura
Pocklington protested that she hated and
despised George, but yet couldn&rsquo;t stay away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington,
tartly, &ldquo;you can stay in the nursery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura. &ldquo;A
man who says such things isn&rsquo;t fit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington shook her head gently.
Mr. Pocklington&rsquo;s Radical principles extended
no more to his household than to his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura dear,&rdquo; she said, in pained tones,
&ldquo;I do so dislike argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So George went to dinner at Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s,
and that lady, remorseless in parental
discipline, sent Laura down to dinner with
him; and, as everybody knows, there is
nothing more pleasing and interesting than
a pretty girl in a dignified pet. George
enjoyed himself. It was a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
since he had flirted; but really now, considering
Isabel&rsquo;s conduct, he felt at perfect
liberty to conduct himself as seemed to him
good. Laura was an old friend, and George
determined to see how implacable her wrath
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so kind of you to give me this
pleasure,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasure?&rdquo; said Laura, in her loftiest
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; taking you down, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma made me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, now you&rsquo;re trying to take me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you can look any one in the
face&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always enjoy looking you in the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the things you&rsquo;ve said about poor
Neaera!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neaera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I call her Neaera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no reason at all. It may even be
her name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman who backbites is bad, but a
man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the deuce?&rdquo; said George inquiringly.</p>

<p>Laura tried another tack. &ldquo;All your
friends think you wrong, even mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that matter, as long as you
think I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t; I don&rsquo;t. I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it&rsquo;s great fun to torment a poor
man who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>George paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who what?&rdquo; said Laura, with deplorable
weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Values your good opinion very highly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George permitted himself to sigh deeply.
A faint twitching betrayed itself about the
corners of Laura&rsquo;s pretty mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to smile, I will look away,&rdquo;
said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very foolish,&rdquo; said Laura; and
George knew that this expression on a lady&rsquo;s
lips is not always one of disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to spend my
time in a vain pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Neaera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not of Neaera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should never,&rdquo; said Laura, demurely,
&ldquo;have referred to Miss Bourne, if you hadn&rsquo;t,
but as you have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presumably George explained whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
did refer to, and apparently the explanation
took the rest of dinner-time. And as
the ladies went upstairs, Mrs. Pocklington
patted Laura&rsquo;s shoulder with an approving
fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good child! It shows
breeding to be agreeable to people you
dislike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura blushed a little, but answered dutifully,
&ldquo;I am glad you are pleased, mamma.&rdquo;
Most likely she did not impose on Mrs.
Pocklington. She certainly did not on
herself.</p>

<p>George found himself left next to Sidmouth
Vane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Neston!&rdquo; said that young gentleman,
with his usual freedom. &ldquo;Locked her
up yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George said Mrs. Witt was still at large.
Vane had been his fag, and George felt he
was entitled to take it out of him in after
life whenever he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish you would,&rdquo; continued Mr. Vane.
&ldquo;That ass of a cousin of yours would jilt
her, and I would wait outside Holloway or
Clerkenwell, or wherever they put &rsquo;em, and
receive her sympathetically&mdash;hot breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
brass band, first cigar for six months, and all
that, don&rsquo;t you know, like one of those Irish
fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no small prejudices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much. A girl like that, <em>plus</em>
an income like that, might steal all
Northampton for what I care. Going
upstairs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s an &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; on, isn&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so I&rsquo;m told. I shouldn&rsquo;t go, if I
were you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the devil not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald&rsquo;s going to be there&mdash;told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Vane, you&rsquo;re very kind. We
shan&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. He&rsquo;s simply
mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he told me you&rsquo;d been trying to
square Mrs. Witt behind his back, and he
meant to have it out with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t run. Come
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guests were already pouring in, and
among the first George encountered was Mr.
Dennis Espion, as over-strained as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Espion knew that George was aware of his
position on the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, how are you, Neston?&rdquo; he said,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>George looked at it for a moment, and then
took it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I support life and your kind attentions,
Espion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! well, you know, we can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;a
matter of public interest. I hope you see
our position&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George, urbanely; &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut
vivre.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you value our opinion,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I value it at a penny&mdash;every
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it, my dear fellow. What you say
has market value&mdash;to the extent I have
mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Neston, may I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider this an interview? My dear
Espion, certainly. Make any use of this
communication you please. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George strolled away. &ldquo;Suppose I was
rather rude,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hang it, I must have earned that fellow fifty
pounds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George was to earn Mr. Espion a little
more yet, as it turned out. He had not gone
many steps before he saw his cousin Gerald
making his bow to Mrs. Pocklington. Mr.
Espion saw him too, and was on the alert.
Gerald was closely followed by Tommy
Myles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the enemy!&rdquo; exclaimed George
under his breath, pursuing his way towards
Laura Pocklington.</p>

<p>The throng was thick, and his progress
slow. He had time to observe Gerald, who
was now talking to Tommy and to Sidmouth
Vane, who had joined them. Gerald was
speaking low, but his gestures betrayed
strong excitement. Suddenly he began to
walk rapidly towards George, the people
seeming to fall aside from his path. Tommy
Myles followed him, while Vane all but ran
to George and whispered eagerly,</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, clear out, my dear
fellow! He&rsquo;s mad! There&rsquo;ll be a shindy,
as sure as you&rsquo;re born!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George did not like shindies, especially
in drawing-rooms; but he liked running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
away less. &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s wait and see,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>

<p>Gerald was looking dangerous. The
healthy ruddiness of his cheek had darkened
to a deep flush, his eyes looked vicious, and
his mouth was set. As he walked quickly
up to his cousin, everybody tried to look
away; but out of the corners of two hundred
eyes eager glances centred on the
pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I have a word with you?&rdquo; Gerald
began, calmly enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As many as you like; but I don&rsquo;t know
that this place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do for what I have to say,&rdquo; Gerald
interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want two things of you. First, you
will promise never to dare to address my&mdash;Mrs.
Witt again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the second?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will write and say you&rsquo;ve told lies,
and are sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I address whom I please and write what
I please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vane interposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Neston&mdash;you, Gerald, I mean&mdash;don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
make a row here. Can&rsquo;t you get him
away, Tommy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald gave Tommy a warning look, and
poor Tommy shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>George felt the necessity of avoiding a
scene. He began to move quietly away.
Gerald stood full in his path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go till you&rsquo;ve answered. Will
you do what I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Gerald,&rdquo; George began, still
clinging to peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said George, with a smile and a
shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, you cur, take&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another moment he would have struck
George full in the face, but the vigilant
Vane caught his arm as he raised it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You damned fool! Are you drunk?&rdquo;
he hissed into his ear. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. Everybody was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; Gerald blurted out.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thrash him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy Myles ranged up and passed his
hand through the angry man&rsquo;s other
arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go, George?&rdquo; asked Vane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said George, calmly; &ldquo;not till he&rsquo;s
quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hush that had fallen on the room
attracted Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s attention. In
a moment, as it seemed, though her movements
were as a rule slow and stately, she
was beside them, just in time to see Gerald
make a violent effort to throw off Vane&rsquo;s
detaining hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot get anybody to go into the
music-room,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and the signora is
waiting to begin. Mr. Neston, give me your
arm, and we will show the way.&rdquo; Then
her eyes seemed to fall for the first time
on George. &ldquo;Oh, you here too, Mr.
George? Laura is looking for you everywhere.
Do find her. Come, Mr. Neston.
Mr. Vane, go and give your arm to a
lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group scattered, obedient to her commands,
and everybody breathed a little sigh,
half of relief, half of disappointment, and
told one another that Mrs. Pocklington was
a great woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In another second,&rdquo; said Tommy Myles,
as he restored himself with a glass of champagne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
&ldquo;it would have been a case of Bow
Street!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it fairly amounts to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fracas</i>,&rdquo;
said Mr. Espion to himself; and as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fracas</i>,
accordingly, it figured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="f8">GERALD NESTON SATISFIES HIMSELF.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, Lord Tottlebury
sat as arbitrator, gave an impartial consideration
to both sides of the question, and
awarded that George should apologise for
his charges, and Gerald for his violence.
Lord Tottlebury argued the case with ability,
and his final judgment was able and conclusive.
Unfortunately, however, misled by
the habit before mentioned of writing to
the papers about matters other than those
which immediately concerned him, Lord
Tottlebury forgot that neither party had
asked him to adjudicate, and, although Maud
Neston was quite convinced by his reasoning,
his award remained an opinion <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>;
and the two clear and full letters which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wrote expressing his views were consigned by
their respective recipients to the waste-paper
basket. Each of the young men thanked
Lord Tottlebury for his kind efforts, but
feared that the unreasonable temper displayed
by the other would render any
attempt at an arrangement futile. Lord
Tottlebury sighed, and sadly returned to
his article on &ldquo;What the Kaiser should do
next.&rdquo; He was in a hurry to finish it,
because he also had on hand a reply to
Professor Dressingham&rsquo;s paper on &ldquo;The
Gospel Narrative and the Evolution of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crustacea</i> in the Southern Seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After his outburst, Gerald Neston had
allowed himself to be taken home quietly,
and the next morning he had so far recovered
his senses as to promise Sidmouth Vane
that he would not again have recourse to
personal violence. He said he had acted on
a momentary impulse&mdash;which Vane did not
believe,&mdash;and, at any rate, nothing of the
kind need be apprehended again; but as for
apologising, he should as soon think of
blacking George&rsquo;s boots. In fact, he was,
on the whole, well pleased with himself,
and, in the course of the day, went off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to Neaera to receive her thanks and
approval.</p>

<p>He found her in very low spirits. She
had been disappointed at the failure of her
arrangement with George, and half inclined
to rebel at Gerald&rsquo;s peremptory <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veto</i> on any
attempt at hushing up the question. She
had timidly tried the line of pooh-poohing
the whole matter, and Gerald had clearly
shown her that, in his opinion, it admitted
of no such treatment. She had not dared
to ask him seriously if he would marry
her, supposing the accusation were true. A
joking question of the kind had been put
aside as almost in bad taste, and, at any rate,
ill-timed. Consequently she was uneasy, and
ready to be very miserable on the slightest
provocation. But to-day Gerald came in a
different mood. He was triumphant, aggressive,
and fearless; and before he had been
in the room ten minutes, he broached his
new design&mdash;a design that was to show conclusively
the esteem in which he held the
vile slanders and their utterer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be married directly! Oh, Gerald!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, darling? It will be the best
answer to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What would your father say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he will approve. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but everybody is talking about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It suits some men to be in love, and Gerald
looked very well as he threw out his defiance
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbi et orbi</i>. Neaera was charmed and touched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald dear, you are too good&mdash;you are,
indeed,&mdash;too good to me and too good for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald said, in language too eloquent to
be reproduced, that nobody could help being
&ldquo;good&rdquo; to her, and nobody in the world was
good enough for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you content to take me entirely
on trust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I am under this shadow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are under no shadow. I take your
word implicitly, as I would take it against
gods and men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who could look in your eyes&rdquo;&mdash;Gerald
was doing so&mdash;&ldquo;and think of deceit? Why
do you look away, sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be&mdash;be&mdash;trusted like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald smiled. &ldquo;Very well; then you
shan&rsquo;t be. I will treat you as if&mdash;as if I
<em>doubted</em> you. Then will you be satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera tried to smile at this pleasantry.
She was kneeling by Gerald&rsquo;s chair as she
often did, looking up at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubted me?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, since you won&rsquo;t let your eyes speak
for you, I will put you to the question.
Will that be enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Neaera! she thought it would be
quite enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will ask you, what I have never
condescended to ask yet, dearest, if there&rsquo;s a
word of truth in it all?&rdquo; Gerald, still playfully,
took one of her hands and raised it
aloft. &ldquo;Now look at me and say&mdash;what
shall be your oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera was silent. This passed words;
every time she spoke she made it worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; pursued Gerald, who was much
pleased with his little comedy. &ldquo;Say this,
&lsquo;On my honour and love, I am not the
girl.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why hadn&rsquo;t she let him alone with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
nonsense about her eyes? That was not,
to Neaera&rsquo;s thinking, as bad as a lie direct.
&ldquo;On her honour and love!&rdquo; She could not
help hesitating for just a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not the girl, on my honour and
love.&rdquo; Her words came almost with a sob,
a stifled sob, that made Gerald full of remorse
and penitence, and loud in imprecations on
his own stupidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all a joke, sweetest,&rdquo; he pleaded;
&ldquo;but it was a stupid joke, and it has
distressed you. Did you dream I doubted
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, say you knew it was a
joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I know it was,&mdash;of course it
was; but it&mdash;it rather frightened me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child! Never mind; you&rsquo;ll be
amused when you think of it presently.
And, my darling, it really, seriously, does
make me happier. I never doubted, but
it is pleasant to hear the truth from
your own sweet lips. Now I am ready
for all the world. And what about the
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t know what day!
Shall it be directly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;directly&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; asked
Neaera, mustering a rather watery smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, after the usual negotiations, Neaera
was brought to consent to that day three
weeks, provided Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s approval
was obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, please, don&rsquo;t quarrel with your
cousin any more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can afford to let him alone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash; Are you going, Gerald?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No time to lose. I&rsquo;m off to see the
governor, and I shall come back and fetch
you to dine in Portman Square. Good-bye
for an hour, darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald, suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash; No, nothing. Good-bye,
dear; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, sweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;well, and don&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald departed in raptures. As soon as
he was out of the room, the tailless cat
emerged from under the sofa. He hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
violent motion of all kinds, and lovers are
restless beings. Now, thank heaven! there
was a chance of lying on the hearth-rug
without being trodden upon!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that, Bob?&rdquo; asked Neaera.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I went the whole hog, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Tottlebury, who was much less inflexible
than he seemed, did not hold out
long against Gerald&rsquo;s vehemence, and the
news soon spread that defiance was to be
hurled in George&rsquo;s face. The <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>
was triumphant. Isabel Bourne and Maud
Neston made a hero of Gerald and a heroine
of Neaera. Tommy Myles hastened to secure
the position of &ldquo;best man,&rdquo; and
Sidmouth Vane discovered and acknowledged
a deep worldly wisdom in Gerald&rsquo;s
conduct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he to Mr. Blodwell,
on the terrace, &ldquo;if it came out before
the marriage, he&rsquo;d stand pledged to throw
her over, with the cash. But afterwards!
Well, it won&rsquo;t affect the settlement, at all
events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell said he thought Gerald had
not been actuated by this motive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, he has,&rdquo; persisted Vane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Before marriage, the deuce! After marriage,
a little weep and three months on the
Riviera!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose, if it came out after marriage,
George would hold his tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you, by Jove? Then he&rsquo;d be the
most forgiving man in Europe. Why, he&rsquo;s
been hunted down over the business&mdash;simply
hunted down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. No, I suppose he&rsquo;d be bound
to have his revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Revenge! He&rsquo;d have to justify himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell had the curiosity to pursue
the subject with George himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the marriage? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.
I should like to score off the lot of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, if I find out anything before,
I shall let them have it. They haven&rsquo;t spared
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;ve got the committee at the
Themis to write and tell me that it&rsquo;s awkward
to have Gerald and me in the same
club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to thank Master Tommy for that.
Of course it means that I&rsquo;m to go; but I
won&rsquo;t. If they like to kick me out, they
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Tommy Myles so hot against you
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those girls have got hold of him&mdash;Maud,
and Isabel Bourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isabel Bourne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George, meeting Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s
questioning eye. &ldquo;Tommy has a mind to
try his luck there, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vice</i> you retired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, retired or turned out. It&rsquo;s like the
army, you know; the two come to pretty
much the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must console yourself, my boy,&rdquo; said
Mr. Blodwell, slyly. He heard of most things,
and he had heard of Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s last
dinner-party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m an outcast now. No one would
look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a humbug, George. Go and
see Mrs. Pocklington, and, for heaven&rsquo;s sake
let me get to my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s practice to inveigle
people into long gossips, and then abuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
them for wasting his time; so George was
not disquieted by the reproach. But he
took the advice, and called in Grosvenor
Square. He found Mrs. Pocklington in,
but she was not alone. Her visitor was
a very famous person, hitherto known to
George only by repute,&mdash;the Marquis of
Mapledurham.</p>

<p>The Marquis was well known on the
turf and also as a patron of art, but it is
necessary to add that more was known of
him than was known to his advantage. In
fact, he gave many people the opportunity
of saying they would not count him
among their acquaintances; and he gave
very few of them the chance of breaking
their word. He and Mrs. Pocklington
amused one another, and, whatever he
did, he never said anything that was open
to complaint.</p>

<p>For some time George talked to Laura.
Laura, having once come over to his side,
was full of a convert&rsquo;s zeal, and poured abundant
oil and wine into his wounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I ever have looked at Isabel
Bourne when she was there?&rdquo; he began to
think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Neston,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington,
&ldquo;Lord Mapledurham wants to know whether
you are <em>the</em> Mr. Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Pocklington has betrayed me, Mr.
Neston,&rdquo; said the Marquis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am one of the two Mr. Nestons, I
suppose,&rdquo; said George, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. George Neston?&rdquo; asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you let him come here, Mrs. Pocklington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know my house is a caravanserai.
I heard you remark it yourself the
other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go,&rdquo; said the Marquis, rising.
&ldquo;And, Mrs. Pocklington, I shall be content
if you say nothing worse of my house. Good-bye,
Miss Laura. Mr. Neston, I shall have
a small party of bachelors to-morrow. It
will be very kind if you will join us. Dinner
at eight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what it is to be an abused man,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Pocklington, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these days the wicked must stand
shoulder to shoulder,&rdquo; said the Marquis.</p>

<p>George accepted; in truth, he was rather
flattered. And Mrs. Pocklington went away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for quite a quarter of an hour. So that,
altogether, he returned to the opinion that
life is worth living, before he left the
house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="f8">REMINISCENCES OF A NOBLEMAN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, many years before this
story begins, a certain lady said, and indeed
swore with an oath, that Lord Mapledurham
had promised to marry her, and claimed ten
thousand pounds as damages for the breach
of that promise. Lord Mapledurham said his
memory was treacherous about such things,
and he never contradicted a lady on a question
of fact: but the amount which his society
was worth seemed fairly open to difference
of opinion, and he asked a jury of his
countrymen to value it. This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</i>,
for such it was in its day, did not improve
Lord Mapledurham&rsquo;s reputation, but, on the
other hand, it made Mr. Blodwell&rsquo;s. That
gentleman reduced the damages to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thousand, and Lord Mapledurham said that
his cross-examination of the plaintiff was
quite worth the money. Since then, the
two had been friends, and Mr. Blodwell
prided himself greatly on his intimacy with
such an exclusive person as the Marquis.
George enjoyed his surprise at the announcement
that they would meet that evening at
the dinner-party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the dickens does he ask you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will destroy the last of your reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not if you are there, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When George arrived at Lord Mapledurham&rsquo;s,
he found nobody except his host
and Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for having nobody to
meet you, Mr. Neston, except an old friend.
I asked young Vane&mdash;whose insolence amuses
me,&mdash;and Fitzderham, but they couldn&rsquo;t
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three&rsquo;s a good number,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re three men. But two men and
a woman, or two women and a man&mdash;awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we are men, though George is a
young one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very young,&rdquo; said George,
smiling, as they sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fifty-five,&rdquo; said the Marquis, &ldquo;and I
feel younger every day,&mdash;not in body, you
know, for I&rsquo;m chockful of ailments; but in
mind. I am growing out of all the responsibilities
of this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of the next?&rdquo; asked Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the next everything is arranged for
us, pleasantly or otherwise. As to this one,
no one expects anything more of me&mdash;no
work, no good deeds, no career, no nothing.
It&rsquo;s a delicious freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never felt your bonds much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but they were there, and every now
and then they dragged on my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your view of old age is comforting,&rdquo;
said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only, George, if you want to realize it,
you must not marry,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;By the
way, Blodwell, why did you never marry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too poor, till too late,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell,
briefly.</p>

<p>The Marquis raised his glass, and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to drink a respectful toast to a dead
romance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Lord Mapledurham?&rdquo; George
ventured to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ask him!&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell.
&ldquo;Perhaps his reason will be less sadly
commonplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the Marquis, pondering.
&ldquo;Some of them expected it, and that
disgusted me. And some of them didn&rsquo;t,
and that disgusted me too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put the other sex into rather a
difficult position,&rdquo; remarked George, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to what they&rsquo;ve put me into.
Eh, Blodwell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me, Mapledurham,&rdquo; said Mr.
Blodwell, who was in a serious mood to-night.
&ldquo;On the whole, have you enjoyed your
life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have wasted opportunities, talents,
substance&mdash;everything: and enjoyed it confoundedly.
I am no use even as a
warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask a parson,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell,
dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; the Marquis went on,
dreamily, &ldquo;an old ruffian&mdash;another old ruffian&mdash;saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
just the same sort of thing one
night. I was at Liverpool for the Cup. Well,
in the evening, I got tired of the other fellows,
and went out for a turn; and down a back
street, I found an old chap sitting on a
doorstep,&mdash;a dirty old fellow, but uncommonly
picturesque, with a long grey beard. As I
came by, he was just trying to get up, but he
staggered and fell back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded. &ldquo;I gave him a
hand, and asked if I could do anything for
him. &lsquo;Yes, give me a drink,&rsquo; says he. I
told him he was drunk already, but he said
that made no odds, so I helped him to the
nearest gin-palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold this cynic&rsquo;s unacknowledged
kindnesses!&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sat him down in a chair, and gave him
liquor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you enjoy getting drunk?&rsquo; I asked
him, just as you asked me if I had enjoyed
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His drink didn&rsquo;t interfere with his tongue,
it only seemed to take him in the legs. He
put down his glass, and made me a little
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Liquor,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;has been my curse;
it&rsquo;s broken up my home, spoilt my work,
destroyed my character, sent me and mine
to gaol and shame. God bless liquor!
say I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him he was an old beast, much as
you, Blodwell, told me I was, in a politer way.
He only grinned, and said, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re a gentleman,
you&rsquo;ll see me home. Lying in the
gutter costs five shillings, next morning,
and I haven&rsquo;t got it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said I; and after another
glass we started out. He knew the way,
and led me through a lot of filthy places to
one of the meanest dens I ever saw. A red-faced,
red-armed, red-voiced (you know what
I mean) woman opened the door, and let fly a
cloud of Billingsgate at him. The old chap
treated her with lofty courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quite true, Mrs. Bort,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
always right: I have ruined myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And yer darter!&rsquo; shrieked the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And my daughter. And I am drunk
now, and hope to be drunk to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! you old beast!&rsquo; said she, just as I
had, shaking her fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He turned round to me, and said, &lsquo;I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
obliged to you, sir. I don&rsquo;t know your
name.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be better off if you did,&rsquo;
says I. &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t drink it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you give me a sovereign?&rsquo; he
asked. &lsquo;A week&rsquo;s joy, sir,&mdash;a week&rsquo;s joy and
life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give it me,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;then me
and she&rsquo;ll get something to eat, to keep us
alive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a benevolent man at bottom, Mr.
Neston, as Blodwell remarks. I said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a sovereign for you and her&rsquo; (I
supposed she meant the daughter) &lsquo;to help in
keeping you alive; and here&rsquo;s a sovereign
for you, sir, to help in killing you&mdash;and the
sooner the better, say I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The liquor&rsquo;s
beginning to lose its taste. And when that&rsquo;s
gone, Luke Gale&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luke who?&rdquo; burst from the two
men.</p>

<p>Lord Mapledurham looked up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter? Gale, I think. I found out
afterwards that the old animal had painted
water-colours&mdash;the only thing he had to do
with water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord hath delivered her into your
hand,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell to George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you drunk too, Blodwell?&rdquo; asked
the Marquis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the woman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked
George, taking out a note-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bort. Going to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Tell me later on, if it&rsquo;s
amusing. There are so precious few amusing
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see the daughter, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course it&rsquo;s the daughter! No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know a man named Witt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never; but, Mr. Neston, I have heard of
a Mrs. Witt. Now, Blodwell, either out with
it, or shut up and let&rsquo;s talk of something
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The latter, please,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell,
urbanely.</p>

<p>And the Marquis, who had out-grown
the vanity of desiring to know everything,
made no effort to recur to the subject.
Only, as George took his leave, he received
a piece of advice, together with a cordial
invitation to come again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Neston,&rdquo; said the Marquis.
&ldquo;I fancy I have given you some
involuntary assistance to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I shall know in a day or
two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To like to be right, Mr. Neston, is the
last weakness of a wise man; to like to be
thought right is the inveterate prejudice of
fools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That last is a hard saying, my lord,&rdquo;
said George, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really depends mostly on your income,&rdquo;
answered the Marquis. &ldquo;Good-night, Mr.
Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George said good-night, and walked off,
shrugging his shoulders at the thought that
even so acute a man as Lord Mapledurham
seemed unable to appreciate his position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all want me to drop it,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;Well, I will, unless&mdash;&mdash;! But to-morrow
I&rsquo;ll go to Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was restless and excited. Home and
bed seemed unacceptable, and he turned into
the Themis Club, whence the machinations of
the enemy had not yet ejected him. There,
extended on a sofa and smoking a cigar, he
found Sidmouth Vane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to Lord Mapledurham&rsquo;s,
Vane?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you been there? I was dining
with my chief. I didn&rsquo;t know you knew
Mapledurham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him yesterday for the first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer old sinner,&rdquo; said Vane.
&ldquo;But have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Is there any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tommy Myles has got engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George started. He had a presentiment
of the name of the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together, my dear boy,&rdquo;
continued Vane. &ldquo;Bear it like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass, Vane. I suppose it&rsquo;s
Miss Bourne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vane nodded. &ldquo;It would really be amusing,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d tell me honestly how
you feel. But, of course, you won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve
begun already to look as if you&rsquo;d never heard
of Miss Bourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I always wonder why fellows do
that. When I&rsquo;ve been refused by a girl,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t been refused by Miss Bourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you would have been, you know.
It comes to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George laughed. &ldquo;I dare say I should;
but I never meant to expose myself to such
a fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, my friend, do you think you&rsquo;re
speaking the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am speaking the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; responded Vane, calmly.
&ldquo;A couple of months ago you meant to ask
her; and, what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;d have had
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George was dimly conscious that this might
be so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my moral,&rdquo; Vane went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your moral?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I took it from the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George groaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They announce the marriage to-night,
and add that they have reason to believe
that the engagement has come about largely
through the joint interest of the parties in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l&rsquo;affaire Neston</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say they are unusually accurate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning thereby, to those who have
eyes, that she&rsquo;s jilted you because of your
goings-on, and taken up with Tommy. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
consequence, you are to-night &lsquo;pointing a
moral and adorning a tale.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, not very soothing, is it? But so it
is. I looked in at Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s, and
they were all talking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pocklingtons were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. And they asked me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who asked you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Violet Fitzderham and Laura
Pocklington,&mdash;if it was the fact that you
were in love with Miss Bourne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said it was matter of notoriety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound your gossip! There&rsquo;s not a
word of truth in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say there was. I said it was a
matter of notoriety. So it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did they believe it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did who believe it?&rdquo; asked Vane, smiling
slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Pocklington, and&mdash;and the
other girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Pocklington and the other
girl, I think, believed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other girl said it served you right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Pocklington said it was time
for some music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, it&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you know you were in
love with her&mdash;in your fishlike kind of way.
Only you&rsquo;ve forgotten it. One does forget
it when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When one&rsquo;s in love with another girl.
Ah, George, you can&rsquo;t escape my eagle eye!
I saw your game, and I did you a kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George thought it no use trying to keep
his secret. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your idea of a kindness,
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;ve made her jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said George, haughtily, &ldquo;I think
this discussion of ladies&rsquo; feelings is hardly in
good taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, old man,&rdquo; answered Vane,
imperturbably. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky that didn&rsquo;t strike
you before you&rsquo;d heard all you wanted to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Vane,&rdquo; said George, leaning forward,
&ldquo;did she seem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Pocklington, or the other girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, damn the other girl! Did she,
Vane, old boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did, a little, George, old boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Vane, tolerantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always a fool myself about these
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go and see them to-morrow. No,
I can&rsquo;t go to-morrow; I have to go out of
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liverpool, on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liverpool, on business! Dear me! I&rsquo;ll
tell you another odd thing, George,&mdash;a
coincidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to Liverpool to-morrow on
business. Well, to-day, Mrs. Witt went to
Liverpool on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said George, for the second
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="f8">PRESENTING AN HONEST WOMAN.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">To</span> fit square pegs into round holes is one of
the favourite pastimes of Nature. She does
it roughly, violently, and with wanton disregard
of the feelings of the square pegs.
When, in her relentless sport, she has at last
driven the poor peg in and made it fit, by
dint of knocking off and abrading all its
corners, philosophers glorify her, calling the
process evolution, and plain men wonder why
she did not begin at the other end, and make
the holes square to fit the pegs.</p>

<p>The square peg on which these trite reflections
hang is poor Neaera Witt. Nature
made her a careless, ease-loving, optimistic
creature, only to drive her, of malice prepense,
into an environment&mdash;that is to say, in unscientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
phrase, a hole&mdash;where she had
need of the equipment of a full-blooded
conspirator.</p>

<p>She resisted the operation; she persistently
trusted to chance to extricate her from the
toils into which she, not being a philosopher,
thought chance had thrown her. If she saw
a weapon ready to her hand, she used it, as
she had used the Bournemouth character, but
for the most part she trusted to luck. George
Neston would fail, or he would relent; or
Gerald would be invincibly incredulous, or,
she would add, smiling at her face in the
glass, invincibly in love. Somehow or other
matters would straighten themselves out;
and, at the worst, ten days more would bring
the marriage; and after the marriage&mdash;&mdash; But
really, ten days ahead is as far as one
can be expected to look, especially when the
ten days include one&rsquo;s wedding.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sidmouth Vane had a knack
of being correct in his information, and he
was correct in stating that Neaera had gone
to Liverpool on business. It was, of course,
merely a guess that her errand might be
connected with George&rsquo;s, but it happened to
be a right guess. Neaera knew well the weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
spot in her armour. Hitherto she had been
content to trust to her opponent not discovering
it; but, as the decisive moment came
nearer, a nervous restlessness so far overcame
her natural <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</i> as to determine her
to an effort to complete her defences, in
anticipation of any assault upon them. She
was in happy ignorance of the chance that
had directed George&rsquo;s forces against her
vulnerable point, and imagined that she herself
was, in all human probability, the only
person in London to whom the name of Mrs.
Bort would be more than an unmeaning
uneuphonious syllable. To her the name
was full of meaning; for, from her youth till
the day of the happy intervention of that
stout and elderly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus ex machina</i>, the late
Mr. Witt, Mrs. Bort had been to Neaera the
impersonation of virtue and morality, and
the physical characteristics that had caught
Lord Mapledurham&rsquo;s frivolous attention had
been to her merely the frowning aspect under
which justice and righteousness are apt to
present themselves.</p>

<p>Neaera was a good-hearted girl, and Mrs.
Bort now lived on a comfortable pension, but
no love mingled with the sense of duty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
inspired the gift. Mrs. Bort had interpreted
her quasi-maternal authority with the widest
latitude, and Neaera shuddered to remember
how often Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s discipline had made
her smart, in a way, against which apathy
of conscience was no shield or buckler.
Recorder Dawkins would have groaned to
know how even judicial terrors paled in
Neaera&rsquo;s recollection before the image of
Mrs. Bort.</p>

<p>These childish fears are hard to shake off,
and Neaera, as she sped luxuriously to Liverpool,
acknowledged to herself that, in that
dreadful presence, no adventitious glories of
present wealth or future rank would avail
her. The governing fact in the situation,
the fact that Neaera did not see her way to
meet, was that Mrs. Bort was an honest
woman. Neaera knew her, and knew that
a bribe would be worse than useless, even if
she dared to offer it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Neaera, resting
her pretty chin upon her pretty hand, &ldquo;that
I should dare.&rdquo; Then she laughed ruefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure she wouldn&rsquo;t beat me;
and if she did, what could I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably Neaera exaggerated even the fearless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
rectitude of Mrs. Bort, but she was so
convinced of the nature of the reception which
any proposal of the obvious kind would meet
with that she made up her mind that her only
course was to throw herself on Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s
mercy, in case that lady proved deaf to a
subtle little proposal which was Neaera&rsquo;s first
weapon.</p>

<p>So far as Neaera knew, Peckton and Manchester
were the only places in which George
Neston was likely to seek for traces of her.
Liverpool, though remote from Peckton, was
uncomfortably near Manchester. Every day
now had great value. If she could get Mrs.
Bort away to some remote spot as soon as
might be, she gained no small advantage in
her race against time and George Neston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she will only go to Glentarroch, he
will never find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glentarroch was the name of a little retreat
in remote Scotland, whither Mr. Witt had
been wont to betake himself for rest and
recreation. It was Neaera&rsquo;s now. It was a
beautiful place, which was immaterial, and
a particularly inaccessible one, which was
most material. Would not Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s despotic
instincts lead her to accept an invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to rule over Glentarroch? Neaera could
not afford to pity the hapless wights over
whom Mrs. Bort would rule.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bort received Neaera in a way
most unbecoming to a pensioner. &ldquo;Well,
Nery,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what brings you here?
No good, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Where&rsquo;s your
mourning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera said that she thought resignation
to Heaven&rsquo;s will not a subject of reproach,
and that she came to ask a favour of Mrs.
Bort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, you come to me when you want something.
That&rsquo;s the old story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera remembered that Mrs. Bort had
often taken her own view of what the supplicant
wanted, and given something quite
other than what was asked; but, in spite
of this unpromising opening, she persevered,
and laid before Mrs. Bort a dazzling picture
of the grandeur waiting her at Glentarroch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall be so much obliged. Really,
I don&rsquo;t know what the servants&mdash;the girls,
especially&mdash;may be doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carryings-on, I&rsquo;ll be bound,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bort. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go yourself,
Nery?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, indeed. I&mdash;I must stay in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasty, cold, dull little place it sounds,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Bort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course I shall consider all
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he!&rdquo; Mrs. Bort sniggered unpleasantly.
&ldquo;So it ain&rsquo;t sech a sweet spot, as ye
call it, after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera recovered herself without dignity,
and stated that she thought of forty pounds
a year and all found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, if I knowed what you was at,
Nery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera intimated that it was simply a
matter of mutual accommodation. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s really no time to be lost,&rdquo; she
said, plaintively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being robbed every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Widows has hard times,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort.
And Neaera did not think it necessary to
say how soon her hard times were coming
to an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come agin to-morrer afternoon, and
I&rsquo;ll tell ye,&rdquo; was Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s ultimatum.
&ldquo;And mind you don&rsquo;t get into mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why afternoon?&rdquo; asked Neaera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m washing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort,
snappishly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera in vain implored an immediate
answer. Mrs. Bort said a day could not
matter, and that, if Neaera pressed her
farther, she should consider it an indication
that something was &ldquo;up,&rdquo; and refuse to
go at all. Neaera was silenced, and sadly
returned to her hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I hate that good, good woman!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never see her again as long
as I live, after to-morrow. Oh, I should like
to hit her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The propulsions of cause upon cause are,
as Bacon has said, infinite. If Mrs. Bort
had not washed&mdash;in the technical sense, of
course&mdash;on that particular Friday, Neaera
would have come and gone&mdash;perhaps even
Mrs. Bort might have gone too&mdash;before the
train brought George Neston to Liverpool,
and his eager inquiries landed him at Mrs.
Bort&rsquo;s abode. As it was, Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s little
servant bade him wait in the parlour, as her
mistress was talking to a female in the
kitchen. The little servant thought &ldquo;female&rdquo;
the politest possible way of describing any
person who was not a man, and accorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the title to Neaera on account of her rustling
robes and gold-tipped parasol.</p>

<p>George did not question his informant,
thereby showing that he, in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of detective,
was a square peg in a round hole. He
heard proceeding from the kitchen a murmur
of two subdued voices, one of which, however,
dominated the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be Mrs. Bort,&rdquo; thought he.
&ldquo;I wish I could hear the female.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his attention wandered, for he made
sure the unknown could not be Neaera, as
she had had a day&rsquo;s start of him. He did
not allow for Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s washing. Suddenly
the dominant voice was raised to the pitch
of distinctness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye told him,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;or have
ye lied to him, as you lied to me
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;You never asked me if I was going to be
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go along! You know how I&rsquo;d
have answered that when ye lived with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked George, with a
slight smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye told him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told him what?&rdquo; asked Neaera; for it
was clearly Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Told him you&rsquo;re a thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This woman&rsquo;s a brute,&rdquo; thought George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. How dare you question
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort; and George
knew she was standing with her arms
akimbo. &ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; she repeated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crescendo</i>;
and apparently her aspect was threatening,
for Neaera cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Do let me
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, if your tongue&rsquo;ll do it.
The truth, will ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said George; for, following
on this last speech, he heard a sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I&mdash;oh, do have mercy
on me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy! It&rsquo;s not mercy, it&rsquo;s a stick you
want. But I&rsquo;ll tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, stop, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little scuffle; then the door
flew open, and Mrs. Bort appeared, with
Neaera clinging helplessly about her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>George rose and bowed politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I intrude,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy mended,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort,
with significance.</p>

<p>Neaera had leapt up on seeing him, and
leant breathless against the door, looking
like some helpless creature at bay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who let you in?&rdquo; demanded the lady
of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your servant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let <em>her</em> in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort, darkly.
&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George looked at Neaera. &ldquo;My name is
Neston,&rdquo; he said blandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neston?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re in nice time; I wanted you,
young man. D&rsquo;ye see that woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I see Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know what she is? Time you
did, if you&rsquo;re a-going to take her to
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to do so,&rdquo; said George, smiling;
&ldquo;and I think I know all about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do ye, now? Happen ever to have
heard of Peckton?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Neaera buried her face in her hands, and
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, pity you haven&rsquo;t something to cry
for! Thought I&rsquo;d see a sin done for ten
pound a month, did ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George interposed; he began to enjoy
himself. &ldquo;Peckton? Oh yes. The shoes,
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bort gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A trifle,&rdquo; said George, waving the shoes
into limbo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious! You ain&rsquo;t in the same line,
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; he asked, still smiling
sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a trifle of forging,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort.
&ldquo;But p&rsquo;raps she got her deserts from me over
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forging?&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Oh ah, yes.
You mean about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her place at Bournemouth? Ah, Nery,
don&rsquo;t you ache yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently Neaera did. She shivered and
moaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; continued Nemesis; and,
she bounded across the room to a cupboard.
&ldquo;There, read that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>George took it calmly, but read it with
secret eagerness. It was the original character,
and stated that Miss Gale began her
service in May, not March, 1883.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I caught her a-copying it, and altering
dates. My, how I did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; interrupted George. &ldquo;I
was afraid it was something new. Anything
else, Mrs. Bort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bort was beaten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you likes it,
it&rsquo;s nothing to me. But lock up your money-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me congratulate you, Mrs. Bort, on
having done your duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an honest woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;by the powers
you are!&rdquo; Then, turning to Mrs. Witt, he
added, &ldquo;Shall we go&mdash;Neaera dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll both of you die on the gallows,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Bort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Neaera,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>She took his arm and they went out,
George giving the little servant a handsome
tip to recompense her for the prospect of
being &ldquo;let in&rdquo; by her mistress.</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s cab was at the door. He handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Neaera in. She was still half-crying and
said nothing, except to tell him the name of
her hotel. Then he raised his hat, and
watched her driven away, wiping his brow
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pheugh!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it now&mdash;and
what an infernal shame it is!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="f8">NOT BEFORE THOSE GIRLS!</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a notorious fact that men of all ages
and conditions quarrel, and quarrel sometimes
with violence. Women also, of a low
social grade, are not strangers to discord, and
the pen of satire has not spared the tiffs and
wrangles that arise between elderly ladies of
irreproachable position, and between young
ladies of possibly not irreproachable morals.
It is harder to believe, harder especially for
young men whose beards are yet soft upon
their chins, that graceful gentle girlhood
quarrels too. Nobody would believe it, if
there were not sisters in the world; but,
unhappily, in spite of the natural tendency
to suppose that all attributes distinctively
earthy are confined to his own sisters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
have no place in the sisters of his friends, a
man of reflection, checking his observations
in the various methods suggested by logicians,
is forced to conclude that here is another
instance of the old truth, that a thing is not
to be considered non-existent merely because
it is not visible to a person who is not meant
to see it. This much apology for the incident
which follows is felt to be necessary in
the interest of the narrator&rsquo;s reputation for
realism.</p>

<p>The fact is that there had been what
reporters call a &ldquo;scene&rdquo; at Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s.
It so fell out that Isabel Bourne,
accompanied by Maud Neston, called on
Laura to receive congratulations. Laura did
her duty, felicitated her friend on Tommy in
possession and Tommy&rsquo;s title in reversion,
and loyally suppressed her personal opinion
on the part these two factors had respectively
played in producing the announced
result. Her forbearance was ill-requited;
for Maud, by way of clinching the matter
and conclusively demonstrating the satisfactory
position of affairs, must needs
remark, &ldquo;And what a lesson it will be for
George!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Laura said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t say that, dear,&rdquo; objected
Isabel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall say it,&rdquo; said Maud; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so exactly
what he deserves, and I know he feels it
himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you so?&rdquo; asked Laura, pausing
in the act of pouring out tea.</p>

<p>Maud laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly, dear. Besides, we are not on
speaking terms. But Gerald and Mr. Myles
both said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald and Mr. Myles!&rdquo; said Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; interposed
Isabel. &ldquo;What has happened made no
difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Isabel, you couldn&rsquo;t have him
after&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabel; &ldquo;but perhaps, Maud,
I shouldn&rsquo;t have had him before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you wouldn&rsquo;t, dear. You saw
his true character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never actually refused him, did
you?&rdquo; inquired Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when he asked you, you know,&rdquo; said
Laura, with a little smile.</p>

<p>Isabel looked at her suspiciously. &ldquo;He
never did actually ask me,&rdquo; she said, with
dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I thought you implied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, of course, she knew he wanted to,&rdquo;
Maud put in. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought so,&rdquo; said Isabel, modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you thought so,&rdquo; said Laura.
&ldquo;Indeed, everybody saw that. Was it very
hard to prevent him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isabel&rsquo;s colour rose. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean, Laura,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Laura smiled with an unpleasantness that
was quite a victory over nature. &ldquo;Men sometimes
fancy,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;that girls are
rather in a hurry to think they want to
propose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; exclaimed Maud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They even say that the wish is father to
the thought,&rdquo; continued Laura, still smiling,
but now a little tremulously.</p>

<p>Isabel grew more flushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
you. One would think you meant that
I had run after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura remained silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows he was in love with
Isabel for years,&rdquo; said Maud, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was very patient,&rdquo; said Laura.</p>

<p>Isabel rose. &ldquo;I shall not stay here to be
insulted. It&rsquo;s quite obvious, Laura, why you
say such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say anything. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next time, you might mention that
among the reasons why you refused Mr.
Neston was, that he never asked you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see what it is,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you, Maud?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Only, I hope&mdash;I wish you
joy of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind a slanderer,&rdquo; added
Maud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;How dare
you say it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, dear, that he doesn&rsquo;t fancy
you&rsquo;re in a hurry&mdash;&mdash; What was your
phrase?&rdquo; said Isabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly shameful,&rdquo; said Maud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t choose to hear a friend run down
for nothing,&rdquo; declared Laura.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend? How very chivalrous you
are! Come, Maud dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Laura,&rdquo; said Maud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;ll be sorry when you come to
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;I do not care to
be insulted any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two visitors swept out, and Laura was
left alone. Whereupon she began to cry.
&ldquo;I do hate that sort of vulgarity,&rdquo; said she,
mopping her eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he ever
thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington entered in urbane majesty.
&ldquo;Well, is Isabel pleased with her little
man?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why, child, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. Those girls have been
horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the engagement, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And poor Mr. Neston&mdash;George Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor George Neston. What did they
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Isabel pretended he had been in love with
her, and&mdash;and was in love with her, and that
she had refused him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, and that made you cry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington smiled. &ldquo;Stop crying,
my dear. It used to suit me, but it doesn&rsquo;t
suit you. Stop, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, mamma,&rdquo; said poor Laura,
thinking it a little hard that she might not
even cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you cry before the girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Laura, with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington.
&ldquo;Now, listen to me. You&rsquo;re never to think
of him again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tiresome, meddlesome fellow. Is your
father in, Laura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. Are you going to see him
about&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as bad as Isabel!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Pocklington, with feigned severity, disengaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Laura&rsquo;s arms from her neck. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
never asked you either!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vanity of these children! There,
let me go; and for goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t be
a cry-baby, Laura. Men hate water-bottles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus mingling consolation and reproof,
Mrs. Pocklington took her way to her
husband&rsquo;s study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want five minutes, Robert,&rdquo; she said,
sitting down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth a thousand pounds a minute,
my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Pocklington, genially, laying
down his pipe and his papers. &ldquo;What
with this strike&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington with
indignation. &ldquo;Why do you let them strike,
Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. They want more
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! They want to be taught
their Catechisms. But I didn&rsquo;t come to talk
about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t, my dear. Your
views are refreshing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert, Laura&rsquo;s got a fancy in her head
about young George Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t tell me much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know all about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very excellent young man. Not
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pauper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. If you&rsquo;re satisfied, I am. But
hasn&rsquo;t he been making a fool of himself about
some woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Robert, how strangely you express
yourself! I suppose you mean about
Neaera Witt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. I heard some rumour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard some rumour! Of course you
read every word about it, and gossiped over
it at the Club and the House. Now, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have,&rdquo; her husband admitted.
&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a young fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to consider it an obstacle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your business. Men know about that
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the child&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, or will be very soon, when he
sees she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Lally!&rdquo; said Mr. Pocklington.
Then he sat and pondered. &ldquo;It is an obstacle,&rdquo;
he said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must put himself right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, prove what he says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, show he had good
excuse for saying it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a little hard. But it&rsquo;s for
you to decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pocklington nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great comfort, Robert, to
have a man who knows his mind on the
premises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be gentle with her,&rdquo; said he, and returned
to the strike.</p>

<p>The other parties to the encounter over
George&rsquo;s merits had by a natural impulse
taken themselves to Neaera Witt&rsquo;s, with the
hope of being thanked for their holy zeal.
They were disappointed, for, on arriving at
Albert Mansions, they were informed that
Neaera, although returned from Liverpool,
was not visible. &ldquo;Mr. Neston has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
waiting over an hour to see her, miss,&rdquo; said
Neaera&rsquo;s highly respectable handmaid, &ldquo;but
she won&rsquo;t leave her room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald heard their voices, and came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose the journey has knocked
her up,&rdquo; suggested Isabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to wait, Gerald?&rdquo; asked
Maud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no. The fact is, she sent me a
message to go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come home with me,&rdquo; said Isabel,
&ldquo;and we will try to console you.&rdquo; Gerald
would enjoy their tale quite as much as
Neaera.</p>

<p>Low spirits are excusable in persons who
are camping on an active volcano, and
Neaera felt that this was very much her
position. At any moment she might be
blown into space, her pleasant dreams shattered,
her champions put to shame, and
herself driven for ever from the only place
in life she cared to occupy. Her abasement
was pitiful, and her penitence, being born
merely of defeat, offers no basis of edification.
She had serious thoughts of running away;
for she did not think she could face Gerald&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
wrath, or, worse still, his grief. He would
cast her off, and society would cast her off,
and those dreadful papers would turn their
thunders against her. She might have consoled
herself for banishment from society
with Gerald&rsquo;s love, or, perhaps, for loss of
his love with the triumphs of society; but she
would lose both, and have not a soul in the
whole world to speak to except that hateful
Mrs. Bort. So she sat and dolefully mused,
with the tailless cat, that gift of a friendly
gaoler at Peckton prison, purring on the rug
before her, unconsciously personifying an
irrevocable past and a future emptied of
delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="f8">CONTAINING MORE THAN ONE ULTIMATUM.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">It</span> was fortunate that Mr. Blodwell was not
very busy on Saturday morning, or he might
have resented the choice of his chambers for
a council, and not been mollified by being
asked to take part in the deliberations. At
eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Gerald Neston
arrived, accompanied by Sidmouth Vane and
Mr. Lionel Fitzderham, who was, in the first
place, Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s brother, and, in the
second place, chairman of the committee of
the Themis Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come, sir,&rdquo; said Gerald, &ldquo;to ask
you to use your influence with George. His
conduct is past endurance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo; asked Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just it. This is Saturday. I&rsquo;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to be married on Monday week; and George
does nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want him to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to acknowledge himself wrong, as
he can&rsquo;t prove himself right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell looked at Fitzderham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t stay as
it is. The lady must be cleared, if she can&rsquo;t
be proved guilty. We arrived clearly at that
conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The committee of the Themis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah, yes. And you, Vane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I concur,&rdquo; said Vane, briefly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
backed George up to now: but I agree he
must do one thing or the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, I suppose you&rsquo;re right.
Only, if he won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we shall take action,&rdquo; said Fitzderham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; said Gerald.</p>

<p>Vane shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. George in, Timms?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; just arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him to step in to me, if he will. I
don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;why you shouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
settle it with him. I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with
it, thank God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George entered. He was surprised to
see the deputation, but addressed himself
exclusively to Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, sir. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell,
&ldquo;think that the time has come for you to
withdraw your allegations or to prove
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, George,&rdquo; said Vane, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
fair to leave Mrs. Witt under this indefinite
stigma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; said Fitzderham.</p>

<p>George stood with his back against the
mantel-piece. &ldquo;I quite agree,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;to-day&rsquo;s Saturday. When is the
wedding, if there&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday week,&rdquo; said Blodwell, hastily,
fearing an explosion from Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. On Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A telegram for you, sir,&rdquo; said Timms,
entering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>He opened and read his telegram. It ran,
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;my handwriting. Will return by
next post registered&mdash;Horne, Bournemouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On Monday,&rdquo; continued George, &ldquo;at five
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I will prove all I
said, or withdraw it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald looked uneasy, but he tried to think,
or at least to appear to think, that George&rsquo;s
delay was only to make his surrender less
abrupt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well! Shall we meet here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;Mrs. Witt ought to
be present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that desirable?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please. I should say not. But
ask her, and be guided by her wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, at Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
suggested Vane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said George. And, with a
slight nod, he left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Mr. Blodwell, &ldquo;that you
have done well in forcing matters to an
extremity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Vane, briefly.</p>

<p>And the council broke up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horne&rsquo;s telegram made George&rsquo;s
position complete. It was impossible for
Neaera to struggle against such evidence,
and his triumph was assured from the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
when he produced the original document
and contrasted it with Neaera&rsquo;s doctored
copy. Besides, Mrs. Bort was in the background,
if necessary; and although an impulse
of pity had led him to shield Neaera at
Liverpool, he was in no way debarred by that
from summoning Mrs. Bort to his assistance
if he wanted her. The Neston honour was
safe, an impostor exposed, and the cause of
morality, respectability, truth, and decency
powerfully forwarded. Above all, George
himself was enabled to rout his enemies, to
bring a blush to the unblushing cheek of the
<cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>, and to meet his friends without
feeling that perhaps they were ashamed to be
seen talking to him.</p>

<p>The delights of the last-mentioned prospect
were so great, that George could not make up
his mind to postpone them, and, in the afternoon,
he set out to call on the Pocklingtons.
There could be no harm in giving them at
least a hint of the altered state of his fortunes,
due, as it was in reality, to Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s
kindness in presenting him to Lord
Mapledurham. It would certainly be very
pleasant to prove to the Pocklingtons, especially
to Laura Pocklington, that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
been justified in standing by him, and that
he was entitled, not to the good-natured
tolerance accorded to honesty, but to the
admiration due to success.</p>

<p>In matters of love, at least, George Neston
cannot be presented as an ideal hero. Heroes
unite the discordant attributes of violence
and constancy: George had displayed neither.
Isabel Bourne had satisfied his judgment
without stirring his blood. When she presumed
to be so ill-advised as to side against
him, he resigned, without a pang, a prospect
that had become almost a habit. Easily and
insensibly the pretty image of Laura Pocklington
had filled the vacant space. As he
wended his way to Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s, he
smiled to think that a month or two ago he
had looked forward to a life spent with
Isabel Bourne with acquiescence, though not,
it is true, with rapture. Had the rapture
existed before, it is sad to think that perhaps
the smile would have been broader now;
for love, when born in trepidation and nursed
in joy, is often buried without lamentation
and remembered with amusement&mdash;kindly,
even tender amusement, but still amusement.
An easy-going fancy like George&rsquo;s for Isabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cannot claim even the tribute of a tear behind
the smile&mdash;a tear which, by its presence,
causes yet another smile. George was not
even grateful to Isabel for a pleasant dream
and a gentle awakening. She was gone;
and, what is more, she ought never to have
come: and there was an end of it.</p>

<p>George, having buried Isabel, rang the bell
with a composed mind. He might ask Laura
Pocklington to marry him to-day, or he
might not. He would be guided by circumstances
in that matter: but at any rate he
would ask her, and that soon; for she was the
only girl he could ever be happy with, and, if
he dawdled, his chance might be gone. Of
course there was a crowd of suitors at her
feet, and, although George had no unduly
modest view of his own claims, he felt it
behoved him to be up and doing. It is true
that the crowd of suitors was not very much
in evidence, but who could doubt its existence
without questioning the sanity and eyesight
of mankind?</p>

<p>As it so chanced, however, George did not
see Laura. He saw Mrs. Pocklington, and
that lady at once led the conversation to the
insistent topic of Neaera Witt. George could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not help letting fall a hint of his approaching
victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington.
&ldquo;But, for your sake, I&rsquo;m very glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it gets me out of an awkward position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what my husband said. He thought
that you were absolutely bound to prove
what you said, or at least to give a good
excuse for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean if you were to keep your
place in society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in your house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he did not go so far as that. Everybody
comes to my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but, Mrs. Pocklington, I don&rsquo;t
want to come in the capacity of &lsquo;everybody.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I think he did mean that you must
do what I say, before you went on coming in
any other capacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George looked at Mrs. Pocklington. Mrs.
Pocklington smiled diplomatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Pocklington out?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington, &ldquo;she is
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not back soon?&rdquo; asked George, smiling
in his turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Neston, I dare say you know
what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. Fortunately, there is no
difficulty. Shall we say Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Tuesday comes, we will see if we
say Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, otherwise, I am&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otherwise, my dear George, you have
no one to persuade except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is the most difficult task of
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that.
Only I hope you believe what you say.
Young men are so conceited nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Miss Pocklington comes in, you
will tell her how sorry I was not to see
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that I look forward to Tuesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I shall say nothing about that.
You are not out of the wood yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Pocklington stood firm; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
George departed, feeling that the last possibility
of mercy for Neaera Witt had vanished.
There is a limit to unselfishness; nay, what
place is there for pity when public duty and
private interest unite in demanding just
severity?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="f8">NEAERA&rsquo;S LAST CARD.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Neaera Witt</span> had one last card to play.
Alas, how great the stake, and how slight
the chance! Still she would play it. If it
failed, she would only drink a little deeper
of humiliation, and be trampled a little more
contemptuously under foot. What did that
matter?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not condemn a woman unheard,&rdquo;
she wrote, with a touch of melodrama.
&ldquo;I expect you here on Sunday
evening at nine. You cannot be so hard as
not to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George had written that he would come,
but that his determination was unchangeable.
&ldquo;I must come, as you ask me,&rdquo; he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
&ldquo;but it is useless&mdash;worse than useless.&rdquo; Still
he would come.</p>

<p>Bill Sykes likes to be tried in a black
coat, and draggle-tailed Sal smooths her
tangled locks before she enters the dock.
Who can doubt, though it be not recorded,
that the burghers of Calais, cruelly restricted
to their shirts, donned their finest linen to
face King Edward and his Queen, or that
the Inquisitors were privileged to behold
many a robe born to triumph on a different
stage? And so Neaera Witt adorned herself
to meet George Neston with subtle simplicity.
Her own ill-chastened taste, fed
upon popular engravings, hankered after
black velvet, plainly made in clinging folds;
but she fancied that the motive would be
too obvious for an eye so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rusé</i> as George&rsquo;s,
and reluctantly surrendered her picture of
a second Queen of Scots. White would be
better; white could cling as well as black,
and would so mingle suggestions of remorse
and innocence that surely he could not be
hard-hearted enough to draw the distinction.
A knot of flowers, destined to be plucked
to pieces by agitated hands&mdash;so much conventional
emotion she could not deny herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&mdash;a
dress cut low, and open sleeves made
to fall back when the white arms were upstretched
for pity,&mdash;all this should make a
combined assault on George&rsquo;s higher nature
and on his lower. Neaera thought that, if
only she had been granted time and money
to dress properly, she might never have seen
the inside of Peckton gaol at all; for even
lawyers are human, or, if that be disputed,
let us say not superhuman.</p>

<p>George came in with all the awkwardness
of an Englishman who hates a scene and
feels himself a fool for his awkwardness.
Neaera motioned him to a chair, and they
sat silent for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent for me, Mrs. Witt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Neaera, looking at the fire.
Then, with a sudden turn of her eyes upon
him, she added, &ldquo;It was only&mdash;to thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have little enough to
thank me for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; your kindness at Liverpool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it seemed the best way out. I hope
you pardon the liberty I took?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for an earlier kindness of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. When they gave me that
money you sent, I cried. I could not cry
in prison, but I cried then. It was the first
time any one had ever been kind to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George was embarrassed. He had an
uneasy feeling that the sentiment was trite;
but, then, many of the saddest things are the
tritest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good of you,&rdquo; he said, stumbling in
his words, &ldquo;to remember it, in face of all
I have done against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You pitied me then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did I do it? How did I? I wish
I had starved; and seen my father starve
first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George wondered whether it was food that
the late Mr. Gale so urgently needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did it. I was a thief; and once a
thief, always a thief.&rdquo; And Neaera smiled
a sad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not suppose,&rdquo; he said, as he
had once before, &ldquo;that I do not make
allowances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allowances?&rdquo; she cried, starting up.
&ldquo;Allowances&mdash;always allowances! never
pity! never mercy! never forgetfulness!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not ask for mercy,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. I know what you mean&mdash;I
lied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you lied, if you choose that word.
You garbled documents, and, when the truth
was told, you called it slander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera had sunk back in her seat again.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let it all
go&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You yourself have made pity impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not impossible! I loved him so,
and he&mdash;he was so trustful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more reason for not deceiving him,&rdquo;
said George, grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, after all?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
changing her tone. &ldquo;What is it, I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ask me, Mrs. Witt, it&rsquo;s an
awkward record.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An awkward record! Yes, but for a man
in love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gerald&rsquo;s look-out. He can do as
he pleases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, after you have put me to open
shame? And for what? Because I loved
my father most, and loved my&mdash;the man who
loved me&mdash;most!&rdquo; George shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were in love&mdash;in love, I say, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
a girl&mdash;yes, if you were in love with me,
would this thing stop you?&rdquo; And she stood
before him proudly and scornfully.</p>

<p>George looked at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it
would,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she asked, advancing a step, and
stretching out her clasped hands, &ldquo;why ask
more for another than for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald will be the head of the family, to
begin with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; the Neston family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are they? Are they famous? I
never heard of them till the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay not; we moved in rather
different circles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you take pleasure in being brutal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take pleasure in nothing connected
with this confounded affair,&rdquo; said George,
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not drop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mere selfishness. You are only
thinking of what people will say of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a right to consider that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mean&mdash;mean and heartless!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>George rose. &ldquo;Really, it&rsquo;s no use going
on with this,&rdquo; said he. And, making a slight
bow, he turned towards the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; cried
Neaera. &ldquo;But I am out of my mind. Ah,
have pity on me!&rdquo; And she flung herself
on the floor, right in his path.</p>

<p>George felt very absurd. He stood, his
hat in one hand, his stick and gloves in the
other, while Neaera clasped his legs below
the knee, and, he feared, was about to bedew
his boots with her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is tragedy, I suppose,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;How the devil am I to get away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never had a chance,&rdquo; Neaera went
on, &ldquo;never. Ah, it is hard! And when at
last&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice choked, and George,
to his horror, heard her sob.</p>

<p>He nervously shifted his feet about, as well
as Neaera&rsquo;s eager clutches would allow him.
How he wished he had not come!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They will
all write about me, and jeer at me; and
Gerald will cast me off. Where shall I
hide?&mdash;where shall I hide? What was it
to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she was silent, but George heard her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
stifled weeping. Her clasp relaxed, and she
fell forward, with her face on the floor, in
front of him. He did not seize his chance of
escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;London is uninhabitable to me, if I do as
you ask,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She looked up, the tears escaping from her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, and the world to me, if you
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George sat down in an arm-chair; he
abandoned the hope of running away. Neaera
rose, pushed back her hair from her face, and
fixed her eyes eagerly on him. He looked
down for an instant, and she shot a hasty
glance at the mirror, and then concentrated
her gaze on him again, a little anxious smile
coming to her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will?&rdquo; she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>George petulantly threw his gloves on a
table near him. Neaera advanced, and knelt
down beside him, laying her hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have made me cry so much,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;See, my eyes are dim. You won&rsquo;t
make me cry any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George looked at the bright eyes, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
veiled in tears, and the mouth trembling on
the brink of fresh weeping. And the eyes
and mouth were very good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Gerald,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he is so strict.
And the shame, the shame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it means to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do indeed: I know it is hard. But
you are generous. No, no, don&rsquo;t turn your
face away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>George still sat silent. Neaera took his
hand in hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, do!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>George smiled,&mdash;at himself, not at Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry any more,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or
the eyes will be red as well as dim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will, you will?&rdquo; she whispered
eagerly.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are good! God bless you,
George: you are good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I am only weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera swiftly bent and kissed his hand.
&ldquo;The hand that gives me life,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said George, rather roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you clear me altogether?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; everything or nothing,&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give me that&mdash;that character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seized his reluctant hand, and kissed it
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leapt up, suddenly radiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, George, Cousin George, how I love
you! Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>George took the document out of his
pocket.</p>

<p>Neaera seized it. &ldquo;Light a candle,&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>George with an amused smile obeyed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hold the candle, and I will burn
it!&rdquo; And she watched the paper consumed
with the look of a gleeful child. Then she
suddenly stretched her arms. &ldquo;Oh, I am
tired!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;You can
leave it to me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However shall I repay you? I never
can.&rdquo; Then she suddenly saw the cat, ran
to him, and picked him up. &ldquo;We are forgiven,
Bob! we are forgiven!&rdquo; she cried,
dancing about the room.</p>

<p>George watched her with amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>She put the cat down and came to him.
&ldquo;See, you have made me happy. Is that
enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is something,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here is something more!&rdquo; And
she threw her arms round his neck, and
kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Any
more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till we are cousins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be gentle in your triumph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; don&rsquo;t talk like that. Are you
going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I must go and put things straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. I&mdash;I hope you won&rsquo;t find it
very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been paid in advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera blushed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall be better paid, if ever I can,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>George paused outside, to light a cigarette;
then he struck into the park, and walked
slowly along, meditating as he went. When
he arrived at Hyde Park Corner, he roused
himself from his reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the woman was very fair!&rdquo; said he,
as he hailed a hansom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="f8">A LETTER FOR MR. GERALD.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pocklington</span> sat with blank amazement
in her face, and a copy of the second edition
of the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite> in her hand. On the middle
page, in type widely spaced, beneath a noble
headline, appeared a letter from George
Neston, running thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&ldquo;To the Editor of the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in">&ldquo;As you have been good enough
to interest yourself, and, I hope, fortunate
enough to interest your readers, in the subject
of certain allegations made by me in
respect of a lady whose name has been mentioned
in your columns, I have the honour to
inform you that such allegations were entirely
baseless, the result of a chance resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
between that lady and another person, and of
my own hasty conclusions drawn therefrom.
I have withdrawn all my assertions, fully and
unreservedly, and have addressed apologies
for them to those who had a right to receive
apologies.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;I have the honour to be, sir,</span><br />
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;George Neston.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>And then a column of exultation, satire,
ridicule, preaching, praying, prophesying,
moralising, and what not. The pen flew
with wings of joy, and ink was nothing
regarded on that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington was a kind-hearted
woman; yet, when she read a sister&rsquo;s vindication,
she found nothing better to say
than&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very provoking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it may be that this unregenerate
exclamation fairly summed up public feeling,
if only public feeling had been indecent
enough to show itself openly. A man shown
to be a fool is altogether too common a
spectacle; a woman of fashion proved a
thief would have been a more piquant dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
But in this world&mdash;and, indeed, probably in
any other&mdash;we must take what we can get;
and since society could not trample on
Neaera Witt, it consoled itself by correcting
and chastening the misguided spirit of
George Neston. Tommy Myles shook his
empty little head, and all the other empty
heads shook solemnly in time. Isabel Bourne
said she knew she was right, and Sidmouth
Vane thought there must be something behind&mdash;he
always did, as became a statesman
in the raw. Mr. Espion re-echoed his own
leaders, like a phonograph; and the chairman
of the Themis thanked Heaven they
were out of an awkward job.</p>

<p>But wrath and fury raged in the breast
of Laura Pocklington. She thought George
had made a fool of her. He had persuaded
her to come over to his side, and had then
betrayed the colours. There would be joy
in Gath and Askelon; or, in other words,
Isabel Bourne and Maud Neston would crow
over her insupportably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never see him or speak to him
again, mamma,&rdquo; Laura declared, passionately.
&ldquo;He has behaved abominably!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This announcement rather took the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
out of Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s sails. She was
just preparing to bear majestically down
upon her daughter with a stern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimatum</i>
to the effect that, for the present, George
must be kept at a distance, and daughters
must be guided by their mothers. At
certain moments nothing is more annoying
than to meet with agreement, when one intends
to extort submission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Laura!&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t care much for the
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Care for him! I detest him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, it hardly looked like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must allow me some self-respect,
mamma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pocklington, entering, overheard these
words. &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, Laura declares that
she will have nothing to say to George
Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just your own view, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; A silence ensued. &ldquo;It seems to me
you are agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It really did look like it; but they had
been on the verge of a pretty quarrel all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the same: and Mr. Pocklington was confirmed
in the opinion he had lately begun
to entertain that, when paradoxes of mental
process are in question, there is in truth
not much to choose between wives and
daughters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, George Neston was steadily
and unflinchingly devouring his humble-pie.
He sought and obtained Gerald&rsquo;s forgiveness,
after half an hour of grovelling abasement.
He listened to Tommy Myles&rsquo;s grave
rebuke and Sidmouth Vane&rsquo;s cynical raillery
without a smile or a tear. He even brought
himself to accept with docility a letter full
of Christian feeling which Isabel Bourne was
moved to write.</p>

<p>All these things, in fact, affected him
little in comparison with the great question
of his relations with the Pocklingtons. That,
he felt, must be settled at once, and, with
his white sheet yet round him and his taper
still in his hand, he went to call on Mrs.
Pocklington.</p>

<p>He found that lady in an attitude of aggressive
tranquillity. With careful ostentation
she washed her hands of the whole affair.
Left to her own way, she might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
inclined to consider that George&rsquo;s foolish
recklessness had been atoned for by his
manly retractation&mdash;or, on the other hand,
she might not. It mattered very little
which would have been the case; and, if
it comforted him, he was at liberty to suppose
that she would have embraced the
former opinion. The decision did not lie
with her. Let him ask Laura and Laura&rsquo;s
father. They had made up their minds,
and it was not in her province or power
to try to change their minds for them. In
fact, Mrs. Pocklington took up the position
which Mr. Spenlow has made famous&mdash;only
she had two partners where Mr. Spenlow
had but one. George had a shrewd idea
that her neutrality covered a favourable
inclination towards himself, and thanked her
warmly for not ranking herself among his
enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am even emboldened,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to ask
your advice how I can best overcome Miss
Pocklington&rsquo;s adverse opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura thinks you have made her look
foolish. You see, she took your cause up
rather warmly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. She was most generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were so very confident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but one little thing at the end
tripped me up. I couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen it.
Mrs. Pocklington, do you think she will be
very obdurate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with it. Don&rsquo;t
ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could rely on your influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any influence,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Pocklington. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as obstinate as a&mdash;as
resolute as her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George rose to go. He was rather disheartened;
the price he had to pay for
the luxury of generosity seemed very
high.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington was moved to pity.
&ldquo;George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I feel like a traitor,
but I will give you one little bit of
advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried George, his face brightening.
&ldquo;What is it, my dear Mrs. Pocklington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to my husband, I say nothing; but
as to Laura&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her alone&mdash;absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her alone! But that&rsquo;s giving it
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call, don&rsquo;t write, don&rsquo;t be known
to speak of her. There, I&rsquo;ve done what I
oughtn&rsquo;t; but you&rsquo;re an old friend of mine,
George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say, Mrs. Pocklington, won&rsquo;t some
other fellow seize the chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she likes you best, what does that
matter? If she doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And Mrs.
Pocklington shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>George was convinced by this logic. &ldquo;I
will try,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, try to let her alone. But it&rsquo;s
difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense. Laura isn&rsquo;t indispensable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know those are not your real views.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not her mother; for which you
may thank Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said George, and took his leave,
rather consoled. He would have been even
more cheerful had he known that Laura&rsquo;s
door was ajar, and Laura was listening
for the bang of the hall door. When
she heard it, she went down to her
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was your visitor, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, George Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did <em>he</em> come about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, to see me, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did he find to say for himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we hardly talked about that affair
at all. However, he seems in very good
spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he has no business to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, my dear; but he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was Mr. Neston. I&rsquo;m
so glad I didn&rsquo;t come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington went on knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect he knew why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington counted three pearl and
three plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he say anything about it, mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One, two, three. About what, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, about&mdash;about my not coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I suppose he thought you were
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask, my dear. He has other
things to think about than being attentive
to young women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very lucky he has,&rdquo; said Laura,
haughtily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, he lets you alone. Why can&rsquo;t
you let him alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura took up a book, and Mrs. Pocklington
counted her stitches in a brisk and cheerful
tone.</p>

<p>It will be seen that George had a good
friend in Mrs. Pocklington. In truth he
needed some kindly countenance, for society
at large had gone mad in praise of Neaera
and Gerald. They were the fashion. Everybody
tried to talk to them; everybody was
coming to the wedding; everybody raved
about Neaera&rsquo;s sweet patience and Gerald&rsquo;s
unwavering faith. When Neaera drove her
lover round the park in her victoria, their
journey was a triumphal progress; and only
the burden of preparing for the wedding
prevented the pair being honoured guests at
every select gathering. Gerald walked on
air. His open hopes were realised, his secret
fears laid to rest; while Neaera&rsquo;s exaggerated
excuses for George betrayed to his eyes
nothing but the exceeding sweetness of her
disposition. Her absolute innocence explained
and justified her utter absence of
resentment, and must, Gerald felt, add
fresh pangs to George&rsquo;s remorse and shame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
These pangs Gerald did not feel it his duty
to mitigate.</p>

<p>Thursday came, and Monday was the
wedding-day. The atmosphere was thick
with new clothes, cards of invitation,
presents, and congratulations. A thorny
question had arisen as to whether George
should be invited. Neaera&rsquo;s decision was in
his favour, and Gerald himself had written
the note, hoping all the while that his
cousin&rsquo;s own good sense would keep him
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be hardly decent in him to
come,&rdquo; he said to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay he will make some excuse,&rdquo;
answered Lord Tottlebury. &ldquo;But I hope
you won&rsquo;t keep up the quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep up the quarrel! By Jove, father,
I&rsquo;m too happy to quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald,&rdquo; said Maud Neston, entering,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s such a funny letter for you! I
wonder it ever reached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held out a dirty envelope, and read
the address&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered">
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mr. Nesston, Esq.</i>,<br />
<span class="sp1">&ldquo;<i>His Lordship Tottilberry</i>,</span><br />
<span class="sp2">&ldquo;<i>London.</i>&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who in the world is it?&rdquo; asked Maud,
laughing.</p>

<p>Gerald had no secrets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Give it me,
and we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; He opened the letter. The
first thing he came upon was a piece of tissue
paper neatly folded. Opening it, he found
it to be a ten-pound note. &ldquo;Hullo! is
this a wedding present?&rdquo; said he with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten pounds! How funny!&rdquo; exclaimed
Maud. &ldquo;Is there no letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s a letter!&rdquo; And Gerald read
it to himself.</p>

<p>The letter ran as follows, saving certain
eccentricities of spelling which need not be
reproduced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="in">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know whether this
here is your money or Nery&rsquo;s. Nor I
don&rsquo;t know <em>where it comes from</em>, after
what you said when you was here with
her Friday. I can work for my living,
thanks be to Him to whom thanks is
due, and I don&rsquo;t put money in my pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as I don&rsquo;t know whose pocket it come
out of.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Susan Bort.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Susan Bort!&rdquo; exclaimed Gerald. &ldquo;Now,
who the deuce is Susan Bort, and what the
deuce does she mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you tell us what she says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Lord Tottlebury.</p>

<p>Gerald read the letter again, with a growing
feeling of uneasiness. He noticed that
the postmark was Liverpool. It so chanced
that he had not been to Liverpool for more
than a year. And who was Susan Bort?</p>

<p>He got up, and, making an apology for
not reading out his letter, went to his own
room to consider the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nery?&rsquo;&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And if I wasn&rsquo;t
there, who was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was generous of George Neston to shield
Neaera at Liverpool. It was also generous
of Neaera to send Mrs. Bort ten pounds
immediately after that lady had treated her
so cruelly. It was honest of Mrs. Bort to
refuse to accept money which she thought
might be the proceeds of burglary. To these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
commendable actions Gerald was indebted
for the communication which disturbed his
bliss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Neaera can throw any light
on it,&rdquo; said Gerald. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very queer. After
lunch, I&rsquo;ll go and see her.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="f8">THERE IS AN EXPLOSION.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Mr. Blodwell</span> was entertaining Lord Mapledurham
at luncheon at the Themis Club.
The Marquis was not in an agreeable mood.
He was ill, and when he was ill he was
apt to be cross. His host&rsquo;s calm satisfaction
with the issue of the Neston affair irritated
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Blodwell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I sometimes
think a lawyer&rsquo;s wig is like Samson&rsquo;s hair.
When he takes it off, he takes off all his
wits with it. Your simplicity is positively
childish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Blodwell gurgled contentedly over
a basin of soup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think no evil unless I&rsquo;m paid for it,&rdquo;
he said, wiping his mouth. &ldquo;George found
he was wrong, and said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the girl in the Park yesterday,&rdquo;
the Marquis remarked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncommonly. But I&rsquo;m not aware that
being pretty makes a girl a thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but it makes a man a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mapledurham!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he ever tell you what he found out
at Liverpool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he go to Liverpool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he go? God bless the man! Of
course he went, to look for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Mapledurham stopped, to see who
was throwing a shadow over his plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I join you?&rdquo; asked Sidmouth Vane,
who thought he was conferring a privilege.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what you are discussing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it? Have you been
listening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but everybody&rsquo;s discussing it. Now,
I agree with you, Lord Mapledurham. It&rsquo;s
a put-up job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you thought it was a put-up job
when they baptised you, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; inquired
the Marquis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And looked for poison in your bottle?&rdquo;
added Blodwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Vane gently waved his hand, as if to
scatter these clumsy sarcasms. &ldquo;A man
may not be sixty and yet not be an ass,&rdquo; he
languidly observed. &ldquo;Waiter, some salmon,
and a pint of 44.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And may be sixty and yet be an ass,
eh?&rdquo; said the Marquis, chuckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among ourselves, why do you suppose
he let her off?&rdquo; asked Vane.</p>

<p>The Marquis pushed back his chair. &ldquo;My
young friend, you are too wise. Something
will happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; exclaimed Vane, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Gerald
Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald came hastily up to Mr. Blodwell.
&ldquo;Do you know where George is?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s in the club somewhere,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t. I want to see him on
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Mapledurham rose. &ldquo;I know your
father, Mr. Neston,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
allow me to shake hands with you, and congratulate
you on your approaching marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald received his congratulations with
an absent air. &ldquo;I must go and find George,&rdquo;
he said, and went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Vane, triumphantly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see there&rsquo;s something up now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elder men tried to snub him, but they
glanced at one another and silently admitted
that it looked as if he were right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s letter had stirred into activity
all the doubts that Gerald Neston had tried
to stifle, and had at last succeeded in silencing.
There was a darkly mysterious tone
about the document that roused his suspicions.
Either there was a new and a more unscrupulous
plot against his bride, or else&mdash;&mdash; Gerald
did not finish his train of thought,
but he determined to see Neaera at once, as
George could not be found without a journey
to the Temple, and a journey to the Temple
was twice as far as a journey to Albert
Mansions. Nevertheless, had Gerald known
what was happening at the Temple, he would
have gone there first; for in George&rsquo;s chambers,
at that very moment, George was sitting
in his chair, gazing blankly at Neaera
Witt, who was walking restlessly up and
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent her ten pounds?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Neaera. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let the
creature starve.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But why in the world did she send it
back to Gerald?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you see? Why, you said you
were Gerald; at least, it came to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she meant to send it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I had told her my Mr. Neston
was Lord Tottlebury&rsquo;s son; so I suppose the
letter has gone to Gerald. It must have, if
you haven&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should she send it to either of
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because I said I sent it with Mr.
Neston&rsquo;s approval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. But it sounded better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s dangerous work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should never have done it, if I had
foreseen this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George knew that this represented Neaera&rsquo;s
extreme achievement in penitence, and did
not press the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wretch the woman is,&rdquo; Neaera
continued. &ldquo;Oh, what is to be done? Gerald
is sure to ask for an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I am lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell him all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; indeed I can&rsquo;t. You won&rsquo;t, will
you? Oh, you will stand by me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Mrs. Bort has said,
and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a knock at the door.
George rose and opened it. &ldquo;What is it,
Timms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gerald, sir, wants to see you on
important business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in his room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I told him you were engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell him Mrs. Witt was here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say I&rsquo;ll be with him in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George shut the door, and said, &ldquo;Gerald&rsquo;s
here, and wants to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald! Then he has got the letter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do, Mrs. Witt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell? I don&rsquo;t know what she
said. She only told me she had sent back
the money, and told him why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she told him why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ruined,&rdquo; said Neaera, wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>George stood with his back to the fireplace,
and regarded her critically. After a
moment&rsquo;s pause, he said, with a smile,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it all&mdash;and you were not ruined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are so good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said George, with a broader
smile.</p>

<p>Neaera looked up at him, and smiled too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t you risk it? Of course, truth
is dangerous, but he&rsquo;s very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heavy step and the sound of impatient
pushing of furniture were heard from the
next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald is getting tired of waiting,&rdquo; said
George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do anything?&rdquo; asked Neaera
again, barely repressing a sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing I were willing to lie, where
is a possible lie? How can I explain it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timms knocked and entered. Gerald
begged for a minute&rsquo;s interview, on pressing
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; said George. Then,
turning to Neaera, he added brusquely,
&ldquo;Come, you must decide, Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera was no longer in a condition to
decide anything. Tears were her ready
refuge in time of trouble, and <a href="#frontispiece">she was
picturesquely weeping</a>&mdash;for she possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that rare gift&mdash;in the old leathern arm-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you leave it to me?&rdquo; asked George.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the best I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera sobbed forth the opinion that
George was her only friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall tell him everything,&rdquo; said George.
&ldquo;Do you authorise me to do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how miserable I am!&mdash;oh, yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then stop crying, and try to look nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I shall bring him in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Neaera in dismay. But when
George went out, she made her hair a little
rougher&mdash;for so paradoxically do ladies set
about the task of ordering their appearance&mdash;and
anointed her eyes with the contents of
a mysterious phial, produced from a recondite
pocket. Then she sat up straight, and
strained her ears to catch any sound from
the next room, where her fate was being
decided. She could distinguish which of the
two men was speaking, but not the words.
First Gerald, then George, then Gerald
again. Next, for full five minutes, George
talked in low but seemingly emphatic tones.
Then came a sudden shout from Gerald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;In your room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had risen, and were moving about.
Neaera&rsquo;s heart beat, though she sat still as
a statue. The door was flung open, and she
rose to meet Gerald, as he entered with a
rush. George followed, with a look of
mingled anger and perplexity on his face.
Gerald flung a piece of paper at Neaera; it
was Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s letter, and, as it fell at her
feet, she sank back again in her chair, with
a bitter little cry. The worst had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God for an honest woman!&rdquo; cried
Gerald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo; she murmured, stretching out
her hands to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you can do that to him!&rdquo; he answered,
pointing to George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I loved you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll believe you, perhaps&mdash;or help you
in your lies. I&rsquo;ve done with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his brow, and
went on. &ldquo;I was easy to hoodwink, wasn&rsquo;t
I? Only a little wheedling and fondling&mdash;only
a kiss or two&mdash;and a lie or two! I
believed it all. And you,&rdquo; he added, turning
on George, &ldquo;you spared her, you pitied her,
you sacrificed yourself. A fine sacrifice!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>George put his hands in his pockets, and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t go on before Mrs. Witt,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not go on! No, no. She&rsquo;s so pure, so
innocent, isn&rsquo;t she? Worth any sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Gerald?&rdquo; said
Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; he asked, with a
sneer. &ldquo;What does a man ask for what
he&rsquo;s done? and what will a woman give?
Will give? Has given?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; said George, laying
a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Neaera sat still, gazing at her lover with
open eyes: only a little shudder ran over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You duped me nicely between you,&rdquo;
Gerald continued, &ldquo;me and all the world.
No truth in it all! A mistake!&mdash;all a mistake!
He found out&mdash;his mistake!&rdquo; His
voice rose almost to a shriek, and ended in a
bitter laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be a brute,&rdquo; said George,
coldly.</p>

<p>Gerald looked at him, then at Neaera, and
uttered another sneering laugh. George was
close by him now, seeming to watch every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
motion of his lips. Neaera rose from her
chair, and flung herself at the feet of the
angry man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Gerald, my love, have pity!&rdquo; she
wailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity!&rdquo; he echoed, drawing back, so that
she fell on her face before him. &ldquo;Pity! I
might pity a thief, I might pity a liar, I have
no pity for a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sentence went unfinished, for, with a
sudden motion, George closed on him, and
flung him through the open door out of the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finish your blackguardism outside!&rdquo; he
said, as he shut the door and turned the
key.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="f8">LAURA DIFFERS.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class="smcap">Ira</span> brevis furor</i>, says the moralist; and the
adjective is the only part of the saw that is
open to exception. Gerald Neston&rsquo;s wrath
burnt fiercely, but it burnt steadily also, and
reflection brought with it nothing but a
stronger conviction of his wrongs. To
George, the interpretation his cousin put on
his action in shielding Neaera seemed to
argue that uncommon degree of wrong-headedness
that is hardly distinguishable
from immorality. Yet, in the recesses of
George&rsquo;s heart lurked the knowledge that
Mrs. Witt, plain, old, unattractive, might
have reaped scant mercy, at his hands; and
Gerald, if he did not believe all he had
brutally hinted, believed quite enough of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to make him regard George as a traitor and
Neaera as an intriguer. What sane man
could have acted as George had acted, unless
under a woman&rsquo;s fascination? Jealousy did
the rest, for Neaera herself had sapped the
strength of her lover&rsquo;s trust in her, and
he doubted not that she who had deluded
him in everything else had not hesitated to
practise on him the last deceit. She and
George were confederates. Need any one
ask how they became so, or what the terms
of the alliance were?</p>

<p>It was hardly wonderful that this theory,
strange as it seemed, should find a place in
Gerald&rsquo;s disordered mind, or that, having
done so, it should vent itself in intemperate
words and reckless sneers. It was, however,
more remarkable that the opinion gained some
general favour. It pleased the cynical, for it
explained away what seemed like a generous
action; it pleased the gossips, for it introduced
into the Neston affair the topic most
congenial to gossips; it pleased the &ldquo;unco
guid,&rdquo; for it pointed the moral of the ubiquity
of sin; it pleased men as a sex, because it
made George&rsquo;s conduct natural and explicable;
it pleased women as a sex, because it ratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the opinion they had always held of beautiful
mysterious widows in general, and of Neaera
Witt in particular. And amid this chorus,
the voice of the charitable, admitting indiscretion,
but asserting generosity, was lost
and hushed, and George&rsquo;s little band of
friends and believers were dubbed blind
partisans and, by consequence, almost accomplices.</p>

<p>Fortunately for George, among his friends
were men who cared little for public reprobation.
Mr. Blodwell did his work, ate his
dinner, said what he thought, and esteemed
the opinion of society much at the value the
Duke of Wellington set upon the views of
the French nation. As for Lord Mapledurham
and Sidmouth Vane, unpopularity
was the breath of their nostrils; and Vane
did not hesitate to purchase the pleasure of
being in a minority by a sacrifice of consistency;
he abandoned the theory which he had
been among the first to suggest, as soon as
the suggestion passed by general acceptance
into vulgarity.</p>

<p>The three men gave George Neston a
dinner, drank Neaera&rsquo;s health, and allowed
themselves an attitude of almost contemptuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
protest against the verdict of society&mdash;a
verdict forcibly expressed by the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite>,
when it declared with not unnatural warmth
that it had had enough of this &ldquo;sordid
affair.&rdquo; But then the <cite>Bull&rsquo;s-eye</cite> had hardly
shown its wonted perspicacity, and Mr.
Espion declared that he had not been treated
in a respectful way. There was no traversing
the fact; George&rsquo;s party fell back on a denial
of the obligation.</p>

<p>Mankind is so constructed that the approbation
of man does not satisfy man, nor that
of woman woman. If all the clubs had been
ringing with his praises, George Neston
would still have turned his first and most
eager glance to Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s. As it
was, he thought of little else than what view
of his conduct would gain the victory there.
Alas! he knew only too soon. Twice he
called: twice was entrance refused him. Then
came a note from Mrs. Pocklington&mdash;an
unanswerable note; for the lady asserted
nothing and denied nothing; she intrenched
herself behind common opinion. She,
as George knew, was a tolerably independent
person so far as her own fame was
concerned: but where her daughter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
interested, it was another thing; Laura&rsquo;s
suitor must not be under a cloud; Laura&rsquo;s
future must not be jeopardied; Laura&rsquo;s affections
must be reposed only where absolute
security could be guaranteed. Mr. Pocklington
agreed with his wife to the full. Hence
there must be an end of everything&mdash;so far
as the Pocklington household was concerned,
an end of George Neston. And poor George
read the decree, and groaned in his heart.
Nevertheless, strange events were happening
behind that door, so firmly, so impenetrably
closed to George&rsquo;s eager feet&mdash;events to Mrs.
Pocklington inconceivable, even while they
actually happened; to her husband, alarming,
reprehensible, extraordinary, puzzling,
amusing, almost, in a way, delightful. In
fine, Laura rebelled. And the declaration
of independence was promulgated on this
wise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington had conveyed to her
daughter, with all delicacy requisite and
imaginable, the new phase of the affair. It
shocked and distressed her to allude to such
things; but Laura was a woman now, and
must know&mdash;and so forth. And Laura heard
it all with no apparent shock&mdash;nay, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
calmness approaching levity; and when she
was told that all communications between
herself and George must cease, she shook
her pretty head and retired to her bedroom,
neither accepting nor protesting against the
decision.</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast she
appeared, equipped for a walk, holding a
letter in her hand. Mrs. Pocklington had
ordered her household, and had now sat
down to a comfortable hour with a novel
before luncheon. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dis aliter visum.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going out, mamma,&rdquo; Laura began,
&ldquo;to post this note to Mr. Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington never made mistakes in
the etiquette of names, and assumed a like
correctness in others. She imagined her
daughter referred to Gerald. &ldquo;Why need
you write to him?&rdquo; she asked, looking up.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nothing more than an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma! He&rsquo;s an intimate friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerald Neston an intimate friend!
Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean Mr. George Neston,&rdquo; said Laura,
in a calm voice, but with a slight blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Pocklington.
&ldquo;What in the world do you want to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to George Neston for? I have said all that
is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I should like to say something
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, certainly not. If you had
been&mdash;if there had been anything actually
arranged, perhaps a line from you would
have been right; though, under the circumstances,
I doubt it. As it is, for you to write
would simply be to give him a chance of
reopening the acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura did not sit down, but stood by the
door, prodding the carpet with the point of
her parasol. &ldquo;Is the acquaintance closed?&rdquo;
she asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember, surely, what I said
yesterday? I hope it&rsquo;s not necessary to
repeat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, mamma; I remember it.&rdquo; Laura
paused, gave the carpet another prod, and
went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just writing to say I don&rsquo;t
believe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s Darling&rdquo; fell from Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s
paralysed grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laura, how dare you? It is enough
for you that I have decided what is to be
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, mamma, when everybody is
turning against him, I want to show him
he has one friend, at least, who doesn&rsquo;t
believe these hateful stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you haven&rsquo;t more self-respect.
Considering what is said about him and
Neaera Witt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother Mrs. Witt!&rdquo; said Laura,
actually smiling. &ldquo;Really, mamma, it&rsquo;s
nonsense; he doesn&rsquo;t care that for Neaera
Witt!&rdquo; And she tried to snap her fingers;
but, happily for Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s nerves,
the attempt was a failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not argue with you, Laura. You
will obey me, and there is an end of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me I was a woman yesterday.
If I am, I ought to be allowed to judge for
myself. Anyhow, you ought to hear what
I have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me that letter, Laura.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, mamma; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; I shall have to write
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to defy me, Laura?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura made no answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington opened and read the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Neston</span>,&rdquo; (it ran)&mdash;</p>

<p class="in">&ldquo;I want you to know that I do
not believe a single word of what they are
saying. I am very sorry for poor Mrs. Witt,
and I think you have acted <em>splendidly</em>. Isn&rsquo;t
it charming weather? Riding in the park
in the morning is a positive delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With kindest regards,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign3">&ldquo;Yours very sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">&ldquo;Laura F. Pocklington.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington gasped. The note was
little better than an assignation! &ldquo;I shall
show this to your father,&rdquo; she said, and
swept out of the room.</p>

<p>Laura sat down and wrote an exact copy
of the offending document, addressed it,
stamped it, and put it in her pocket. Then,
with ostentatious calmness, she took up
&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s Darling,&rdquo; and appeared to become
immersed in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pocklington found it hard to make
her husband appreciate the situation; indeed,
she had scarcely risen to it herself. Everybody
talks of heredity in these days: the
Pocklingtons, both people of resolute will,
had the opportunity of studying its working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in their own daughter. The result was fierce
anger in Mrs. Pocklington, mingled anger
and admiration in her husband, perplexity in
both. Laura&rsquo;s position was simple and well
defined. By coercion and imprisonment she
might, she admitted, be prevented sending
her letter and receiving a reply, but by no
other means. Appeals to duty were met by
appeals to justice; she parried entreaty by
counter-entreaty, reproofs by protestations of
respect, orders by silence. What was to be
done? Laura was too old, and the world was
too old, for violent remedies. Intercepting
correspondence meant exposure to the household.
The revolt was appalling, absurd,
unnatural; but it was also, as Mr. Pocklington
admitted, &ldquo;infernally awkward.&rdquo; Laura realised
that its awkwardness was her strength,
and, having in vain invited actual physical
restraint, in its absence walked out and
posted her letter.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pocklington acted. At a day&rsquo;s
notice she broke up her establishment for the
season, and carried her daughter off with her.
She gave no address save to her husband.
Laura was not allowed to know whither she
was being taken. She was, as she bitterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;spirited away&rdquo; by the continental
mail, and all the communications cut. Only,
just as the brougham was starting, when the
last box was on, and Mr. Pocklington, having
spoken his final word of exhortation,
was waving good-bye from the steps, Laura
jumped out, crossed the road, and dropped a
note into a pillar-box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only,&rdquo; she remarked, resuming her
seat, &ldquo;to tell Mr. Neston that I can&rsquo;t give
him any address at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What, asked Mrs. Pocklington of her
troubled mind, were you to do with a girl
like that?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="f8">GEORGE NEARLY GOES TO BRIGHTON.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, about a week after what Mr.
Espion called the final <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esclandre</i>, Tommy
Myles made his appearance in the smoking-room
of the Themis. More important matters
have ousted the record of Tommy&rsquo;s marriage
and blissful honeymoon, and he came back to
find that a negligent world had hardly noticed
his absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said he to Sidmouth
Vane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said Vane, raising his
eyes for a moment from <cite>Punch</cite>.</p>

<p>Tommy sat down by him. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;this Neston business is rather
neat. We read about it in Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been away?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have&mdash;after my wedding,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Seen <cite>Punch</cite>?&rdquo; And Vane handed
it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a pretty shrewd idea of how the
land lay. So had Bella.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a thousand pardons. I thought you
rather backed Mrs. Witt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, we wanted her to have
fair play. I suppose there&rsquo;s no question of
the marriage now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fair Mrs. Witt going to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vane wanted to be let alone, and Tommy
worried him. He turned on the little gentleman
with some ferocity. &ldquo;My dear Tommy,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you backed her through thick and
thin, and blackguarded George for attacking
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whoever was right, you weren&rsquo;t,
so hadn&rsquo;t you better say no more about
it?&rdquo; And Mr. Vane rose and walked
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, he was thoughtful. What would
Mrs. Witt do next? And what would George
Neston do? Vane knew of cases where the
accusation suggests the crime; it seemed not
unlikely that if George had to bear the contumely
attaching to a connection with Mrs.
Witt, he might think it as well to reap the
benefit. He might not have sought to win
her favour yet, but it was very possible he
might do so now. If he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, some
one would. And Mr. Vane considered that
he might find it worth his while to be
the man. His great relatives would cry
aloud in horror; society would be shocked.
But a man will endure something for
a pretty woman and five thousand a
year. Only, what did George Neston mean
to do?</p>

<p>It will be seen that Sidmouth Vane did not
share Laura Pocklington&rsquo;s conviction that
George cared nothing for Mrs. Witt. Of
course he had not Laura&rsquo;s reasons: and perhaps
some difference between the masculine
and feminine ways of looking at such things
must be allowed for. As it happened, however,
Vane was right&mdash;for a moment. After
George had been for a second time repulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
from Mrs. Pocklington&rsquo;s doors, finding the
support of his friends unsatisfying and
yearning for the more impassioned approval
that women give, he went the
next day to Neaera&rsquo;s, and intruded on the
sorrow-laden retirement to which that
wronged lady had betaken herself. And
Neaera&rsquo;s grief and gratitude, her sorrow
and sympathy, her friendship and fury,
were all alike and equally delightful to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The meanness of it!&rdquo; she cried with
flashing eyes. &ldquo;Oh, I would rather die than
have a petty soul like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald was, of course, the subject of these
strictures, and George was content not to
contradict them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He evidently,&rdquo; continued Neaera, &ldquo;simply
cannot understand your generosity. It&rsquo;s
beyond him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t rate what you call
my generosity too high,&rdquo; said George.
&ldquo;But what are you going to do, Mrs.
Witt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera spread her hands out with a gesture
of despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to do? I am&mdash;desolate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I. We must console one
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech was indiscreet. George
recognised it, when Neaera&rsquo;s answering
glance reached him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will make them talk worse than
ever,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;You ought never
to speak to me again, Mr. Neston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are damned beyond redemption,
so we may as well enjoy ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t shock your friends still
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no friends left to shock,&rdquo; replied
George, bitterly.</p>

<p>Neaera implored him not to say that,
running over the names of such as might be
supposed to remain faithful. George shook
his head at each name: when the Pocklingtons
were mentioned, his shake was big with
sombre meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;and
now what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. I think some of us are
going to have a run to Brighton. I shall go,
just to get out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Brighton nice now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicer than London, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Neston&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Witt? Why don&rsquo;t you come
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, you&rsquo;d&mdash;you and your friends&mdash;be
somebody to speak to, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said Neaera, resting her chin on her hand
and gazing at George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you must come. We shall be
very jolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor us! But perhaps it will console us
to mingle our tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she said with a laugh.
&ldquo;It must be purely accidental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fortuitous concurrence? Very well.
We go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know when you
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera laughed again, and George took
his leave, better pleased with the world than
when he arrived. A call on a pretty woman
often has this effect; sometimes, let us add,
to complete our commonplace, just the
opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he argued to himself.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should get all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
blame for nothing. If they think it of me,
I may as well do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when George reached his lodgings, he
found on the table, side by side with Mr.
Blodwell&rsquo;s final letter about the Brighton
trip, Laura Pocklington&rsquo;s note. And then&mdash;away
went Brighton, and Neaera Witt, and
the reckless defiance of public opinion, and
all the rest of it! And George swore at
himself for a heartless, distrustful, worthless
person, quite undeserving to receive
such a letter from such a lady. And
when the second letter came the next
morning, he swore again, at himself for
his meditated desertion, and by all his
gods, that he would be worthy of such
favour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child&rsquo;s a trump,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a regular
trump! And she shan&rsquo;t be worried by
hearing of me hanging about in Mrs. Witt&rsquo;s
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The happy reflections which ensued were
appropriate, but hackneyed, being in fact
those of a man much in love. It is, however,
worth notice that Laura&rsquo;s refusal to think
evil had its reward: for if she had suspected
George, she would never have shown him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
her heart in those letters; and, but for those
letters, he might have gone to Brighton,
and&mdash;&mdash;; whereas what did happen was something
quite different.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="f8">SOME ONE TO SPEAK TO.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Being</span> a public character, although an object
of ambition to many, has its disadvantages.
Fame is very pleasant, but we do not want
everybody in the hotel to point at us when
we come down to dinner. When Neaera
went to Brighton&mdash;for it is surely unnecessary
to say that she intended to go and did
go thither&mdash;she felt that the fame which had
been thrust upon her debarred her from
hotels, and she took lodgings of a severely
respectable type, facing the sea. There she
waited two days, spending her time walking
and driving where all the world walks and
drives. There were no signs of George,
and Neaera felt aggrieved. She sent him
a line, and waited two days more. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
she felt she was being treated as badly as
possible&mdash;unkindly, negligently, faithlessly,
disrespectfully. He had asked her to come;
the invitation was as plain as could be:
without a word, she was thrown over!
In great indignation she told her maid to
pack up, and, meanwhile, sallied out to see
if the waves would perform their traditional
duty of soothing a wounded spirit. The
task was a hard one; for, whatever Neaera
Witt had suffered, neglect at the hands of
man was a grief fortune had hitherto spared
her.</p>

<p>She forsook the crowded parade, and
strolled down by the water&rsquo;s edge. Presently
she sat down under the shade of a
boat, and surveyed the waters and the future.
She felt very lonely. George had seemed
inclined to be pleasant but now he had
deserted her. She had no one to speak to.
What was the use of being pretty and
rich? Everything was very hard and she
had done no real harm, and was a very,
very miserable girl, and&mdash;&mdash; Under the
shade of the boat, Neaera cried a little,
choosing the moment when there were no
passers-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>But one who came from behind escaped
her vigilance. He saw the gleam of golden
hair, and the slim figure, and the little
shapely head bowing forward to meet the
gloved hands; and he came down the beach,
and, standing behind her for a moment,
heard a little gurgle of distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Can I
help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera looked up with a start. The
upright figure, bravely resisting a growing
weight of years, the iron-grey hair, the
hooked nose, and pleasant keen eyes seemed
familiar to her. Surely she had seen him
in town!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mrs. Witt!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
are acquaintances, or we ought to be.&rdquo; And
he held out his hand, adding, with a smile,
&ldquo;I am Lord Mapledurham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Neaera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Marquis. &ldquo;Now, I know
all about it, and it&rsquo;s a burning shame. And,
what&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s all my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your fault?&rdquo; she said, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I warned George Neston to
let it alone. But he&rsquo;s a hot-headed fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought him that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, though. Well, look at this. He
asks Blodwell, and Vane, and me&mdash;at least,
he didn&rsquo;t ask me, but Blodwell did&mdash;to
make a party here. We agree. The next
moment&mdash;hey, presto! he&rsquo;s off at a
tangent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neaera could not make up her mind
whether Lord Mapledurham was giving this
explanation merely to account for his own
presence or also for her information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, you see,&rdquo; the Marquis resumed,
&ldquo;his affairs are rather troublesome.
He&rsquo;s out of favour with the authorities, you
know&mdash;Mrs. Pocklington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he mind about Mrs. Pocklington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He minds about Miss Pocklington, and
I suspect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she minds about him. I met Pocklington
at the club yesterday, and he told
me his people had gone abroad. I said it
was rather sudden, but Pocklington turned
very gruff, and said &lsquo;Not at all.&rsquo; Of course
that wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope she will be good to him,&rdquo;
said Neaera. &ldquo;Fancy, if I were the
cause&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As I said at the beginning,&rdquo; interrupted
the Marquis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he settled himself by her side, and
told her how his reminiscence had been the
first thing to set George on the track of
discovery, whence all the trouble had resulted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;you have to
put all your woes down to my chatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she said, dreamily, looking
out to sea.</p>

<p>The Marquis nodded, his eyes scanning
her face.</p>

<p>Then she turned to him suddenly, and
said, &ldquo;I was very young, you know, and&mdash;rather
hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a sinner myself,&rdquo; he answered,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and what I did afterwards, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to make my confession, not to
hear yours. How shall I atone for all I
have brought on you? What shall I do
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I only want some friends, and&mdash;and
some one to speak to,&rdquo; said Neaera, with a
forlorn little sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marquis took her hand and kissed it
gallantly. &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said he, smiling,
&ldquo;perhaps we may manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Neaera, putting her handkerchief
into her pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Blodwell and Vane are
here too, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care about them; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all on your side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they? I needn&rsquo;t see more of them
than I like, need I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marquis was not young, no, nor inexperienced;
but, all the same, he was not
proof against this flattery. &ldquo;Perhaps they
won&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He smiled at her, and, after a moment of
innocent seriousness, her lips wavered into
an answering smile.</p>

<p>The Marquis, after taking tea with Neaera
and satisfying himself that the lady was not
planning immediate flight, strolled back to
his hotel in a thoughtful mood. He enjoyed
a little triumph over Mr. Blodwell and Sidmouth
Vane at dinner; but this did not
satisfy him. For almost the first time in his
life, he felt the need of an adviser and confidant:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he was afraid that he was going to
make a fool of himself. Mr. Blodwell withdrew
after dinner, to grapple with some
papers which had pursued him, and the Marquis
sat smoking a cigar on a seat with Vane,
struggling against the impulse to trust that
young man with his thoughts. Vane was
placidly happy: the distant, hypothetical
relations between himself and Neaera, the
like of which his busy idle brain constructed
around every attractive marriageable woman
he met, had no power to disturb either his
soul or his digestion. If it so fell out, it
would be well; but he was conscious that
the object would wring from him no very
active exertions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Witt expected to find George here,
I suppose?&rdquo; he asked, flicking the ash from
his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything on there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, my dear fellow,&rdquo; replied the
Marquis, with more confidence than he would
have shown twelve hours before. &ldquo;She knows
he&rsquo;s mad about little Laura Pocklington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on her to-morrow,&rdquo; said Vane,
with his usual air of gracious condescension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s living very quietly,&rdquo; remarked the
Marquis.</p>

<p>Vane turned towards him with a smile and
almost a wink. &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be respectful to your elders, you young
dog,&rdquo; said the Marquis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make us forget your claims in that
respect. You must be more venerable,&rdquo;
answered Vane.</p>

<p>After a moment&rsquo;s silent smoking, &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you marry?&rdquo; asked the Marquis. It
is a question which often means that the
questioner&rsquo;s own thoughts are trending in
that direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for that heiress.&rdquo; Then he
added, perhaps out of good nature, &ldquo;If it
comes to that, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not anxious to have people pointing
at me for an old fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang people! Besides, you&rsquo;re not
old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty-six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re laughing!&rdquo; said the Marquis,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marquis laughed too, and put his cigar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
back in his mouth. He took it out again
almost at once. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be bad to have
a son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean an heir, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first step is a wife then, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most women are so tedious. Still, you
understand my feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might in your position. For myself,
I hate brats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you will feel it some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vane thought this rather barefaced. &ldquo;When
did it attack you?&rdquo; he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; answered the Marquis,
gravely.</p>

<p>Vane&rsquo;s cynical humour was tickled by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûment</i> this admission suggested. &ldquo;Gad!
I should like to see Gerald Neston&rsquo;s face!&rdquo;
he chuckled, forgetting his own designs in
his gratification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s&mdash;well, the deuce of a
flirt,&rdquo; said the Marquis.</p>

<p>Vane risked a philosophical generalisation.
&ldquo;All nice women are flirts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what you mean when you call them nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pretty and attractive, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the shoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the shoes!&rdquo; said the Marquis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, Mr. Blodwell and Sidmouth
Vane went to London; but the society
papers recorded that the Marquis of Mapledurham
prolonged his stay at Brighton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="f8">FATE&rsquo;S INSTRUMENTS.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Summer</span> and autumn came and went. The
season died lingeringly and suffered its slow
resurrection. Grouse and partridges, autumn
scares and vacation speeches, the yield of the
crops and the beginning of the session each
had their turn of public favour, and the great
Neston sensation died away, galvanised now
and again into a fitful spasm of life by Mr.
Espion&rsquo;s persevering battery. His efforts
were in vain. All the cats were out of all
the bags, and the interest of the public was
satiated. The actors in the drama, returning
to town, as most of them did in the
winter, found themselves restored to obscurity;
their story, once so eagerly dished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
up as the latest gossip, was now the
stale stock of bores, useful only to regale
the very young or the very provincial
palate.</p>

<p>All at once, there was a revival. A
rumour, a piquant rumour, began to be
whispered at the clubs. Men again looked
at Gerald Neston, wondering if he had heard
it, and at George, asking how he would
take it. Mr. Blodwell had to protest
ignorance twenty times a day, and Sidmouth
Vane intrenched himself in the safe
seclusion of his official apartment. If
it were true, it was magnificent. Who
knew?</p>

<p>Mr. Pocklington heard the rumour, but,
communing with his own heart, held his
tongue. He would not disturb the peace
that seemed again to have settled on his
house. Laura, having asserted her independence,
had allowed the subject to drop; she
had been bright, cheerful, and docile, had
seen sights, and gone to entertainments, and
made herself agreeable; and Mrs. Pocklington
hoped, against a secret conviction, that the
rebellion was not only sleeping but dead.
She could not banish herself from London;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
so, with outward confidence and inward fear,
she brought her daughter home in November,
praying that George Neston might not cross
her path, praying too, in her kind heart, that
time might remove the silent barrier between
her and her daughter, against which she
fretted in vain.</p>

<p>But certain other people had no idea of
leaving the matter to the slow and uncertain
hand of time. There was a plot afoot.
George was in it, and Sidmouth Vane, and
Mr. Blodwell; so was the Marquis, and
another, whose present name it would ruin
our deep mystery to disclose&mdash;if it be guessed,
there is no help for it. And just when Laura
was growing sad, and a little hurt and angry
at hearing nothing from George, she chanced
to have a conversation with Sidmouth Vane,
and emerged therefrom, laughing, blushing,
and riotously happy, though the only visible
outcome of the talk was an invitation for
her mother and herself to join in the mild
entertainment of afternoon tea at Vane&rsquo;s
rooms the next day. Now, Sidmouth Vane
was very deceitful; he, so to say, appropriated
to his own use and credit Laura&rsquo;s
blushes and Laura&rsquo;s laughter, and, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
invitation came, innocent Mrs. Pocklington,
without committing herself to an approval
of Mr. Vane, rejoiced to think it
pleased Laura to take tea with any
young man other than George Neston,
and walked into the trap with gracious
urbanity.</p>

<p>Vane received his guests, Mr. Blodwell
supporting him. Mrs. Pocklington and
her daughter were the first arrivals, and
Vane apologised for the lateness of the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Mapledurham is coming,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s been very busy lately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he was out of town,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Pocklington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He only came back yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door opened, and Vane&rsquo;s servant
announced with much pomp, &ldquo;The Marquis
and Marchioness of Mapledurham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marquis advanced straight to Mrs.
Pocklington; then he took Neaera&rsquo;s hand,
and said, &ldquo;You have always been good to
me, Mrs. Pocklington. I hope you&rsquo;ll be as
good to my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hushed up as far as possible,
but still it leaked out that, on this sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
occasion, Mrs. Pocklington was at a loss&mdash;was,
in fact, if the word be allowable,
flabbergasted. Vane maliciously hinted
at burnt feathers and other extreme
remedies, and there was really no doubt at
all that Laura untied her mother&rsquo;s bonnet-strings.</p>

<p>Neaera stood looking on, half proud,
half frightened, till Laura ran to her
and kissed her, and called her the best
friend she had, with much other emotional
language.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Pocklington came round, and
took a cup of tea, and, still unconsciously doing
just as she was meant to do, drifted into
the balcony with the Marquis, and had a long
conversation with him. When she came
back, she found Vane ordering a fresh pot of
tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must really be going,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t we, Laura?&rdquo; And as she spoke
she took her daughter&rsquo;s hand and patted it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect any one else, Vane?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Blodwell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did, but he&rsquo;s very late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where can he have got to?&rdquo; asked
Neaera, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know where he is,&rdquo; said Vane.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s only in the next room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody looked at Mrs. Pocklington
and smiled. She looked at them all,
and last at her daughter. Laura was
smiling too, but her eyes were eager and
imploring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he wants any tea, he had better come
in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pocklington.</p>

<p>So the pair of shoes wrought out their
work, giving society yet another sensation,
making Neaera Witt a great lady, and Laura
Pocklington a happy woman, and confirming
all Mrs. Bort&rsquo;s darkest views on the
immorality of the aristocracy. And the
Marquis and George Neston put their heads
together, and caused to be fashioned two
dainty little shoes in gold and diamonds,
and gave them to their wives, as a sign
and remembrance of the ways of destiny.
And Neaera wears the shoe, and will
talk to you quite freely about Peckton
Gaol.</p>

<p>The whole affair, however, shocked Lord
Tottlebury very deeply, and Gerald Neston
is still a bachelor. Whether this fate be a
reward for the merits he displayed, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
punishment for the faults he fell into, let
each, according to his prejudices or his experience,
decide. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non nostrum est tantas componere lites.</i></p>
